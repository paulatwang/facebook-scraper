Baulkham Hills takeaway Hillbilly’s Crispy Chicken, which is owned by chef Eric Tay, failed after All Business Accounting Solutions obtained a court order to have it placed into liquidation.Eric Tay's Baulkham Hills restaurant has collapsed. Picture: Facebook.Liquidator Troy Graham, from Taylor Insolvency, said a dispute that ran for months over a financial advice bill of about $5,000 had led to a legal process that was now set to cost close to $8,000.“I can only see the reason for this company going into liquidation, as the result of a dispute with a creditor who has unpaid bills,” Mr Graham told Daily Mail Australia.“The director didn’t have the financial means to be able to fund a defence in court, it is really sad.” “The cost of winding the company up appears to be more than the principal debt that was owed to the creditor.”Mr Graham added that initial investigations showed the company did not owe any rent or staff wages.According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Tay trained former MasterChef judge George Calombaris, pictured.

The menu offered burgers with three beef patties and southern fried chicken burgers with maple bacon and blue cheese, among other unique combos.Just five days ago, the takeaway shop posted to Instagram about one of their specials called The Sticky Hoof – a fried chicken burger with salad, French goat’s cheese drizzled with Manuka honey and topped with spicy pineapple chutney.Baulkham Hills restaurant Hillbilly’s Crispy Chicken.

Brilliant performance. Just goes to show what more football at this level can do for you. It looked like Australia learned nothing from their win the week before. “Lazy performance would reflect a lazy and complacent preparation. Maybe even a complacent selection process. Anyway, that’s for smarter people than me to work out. Australia produced an embarrassing performance.The Kiwis dominated Australia to win the Pacific Championships. (Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images)“Someone has to put their hand up and take sone responsibility. Full credit to Kiwis. They did their homework and displayed the kind of effort and passion your National jersey should inspire. The more Test football they play, the better they will get too. Well done.”It was Australia’s heaviest defeat in history, a performance Greg Alexander called an “embarrassing result for Australian rugby league”.“Mentally they weren’t prepared for what the Kiwis were going to throw at them,” Alexander said on Fox League.“They would have known, they knew it was coming after beating New Zealand last week. I’m sure Mal (Meninga) spoke that the ambush was coming.“But the Kiwis embarrassed them (Kangaroos) this afternoon. It’s an embarrassing result for Australian rugby league.”It was a humiliating loss for the Kangaroos. (Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images)Cooper Cronk, who made 38 appearances for the Kangaroos, pointed to the collective effort from the Kiwis that proved pivotal in the victory.“You’ve got a contribution from everyone for New Zealand and they just absolutely handcuffed Australia at different stages,” Cronk said.“Maybe after the performance last week, there’s a little bit of complacency.“Under Mal, they’ve played 26 games and that’s only his third loss as Australian coach. He’s had a lot of success that the playing group has probably been used to.Calls are growing louder for Kangaroos captain James Tedesco to be replaced in the No. 1 jersey and make way for other candidates for the fullback position including Dylan Edwards, Reece Walsh and Kalyn Ponga.Edwards made his rep footy debut for the Kangaroos on the wing in the Pacific Championships and Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga spoke glowingly about the Panthers star ahead of Saturday’s final.James Tedesco’s days as a representative fullback might be numbered. (Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images)“Versatility is really important at the rep level, there’s no doubt about that,” Meninga said.“Dylan is a great fella and he’s a highly intelligent player. He did start his career on the wing for Penrith, he got his first shot at first-grade on the wing, and he’s handled it really well.I absolutely adore James Tedesco as a player. He is IMO in the top 5 fullbacks Iâ€™ve ever seen & has done it all. Unfortunately i think his days as a representative fullback are over. Heâ€™s lost that edge that separated him from the rest. Time to call it a day Teddy.— The Oracle (@BigOtrivia) November 4, 2023More CoverageLeague greats savage 115-year humiliationAussies flogged in ‘embarrassing’ humiliation“His footy IQ is enormous. Obviously he’s great under the high ball and his kick-reception work, which he does at fullback anyway, is really strong, and he’s got a good sense defensively.“He deserves to be there. He’s just been hanging on the fringe because of James Tedesco. I’m a big fan of James and what he’s done in the game, so that’s got to be respected. His (Edwards’) form in the NRL in the last few years deserves an opportunity to play representative football.”The victory was a feather in the cap of coach Michael Maguire, who will take on two representative footy roles after reportedly accepting an offer to replace Brad Fittler as NSW’s State of Origin coach.",0.07,0.791,0.139,0.9957

She told me eight men were looking at the photo and all freaking out.”Out of options, Tessa went to her local Apple Store in a desperate bid that a “Genius” would be able to help her figure out what had gone down.She waited two hours to speak to somebody, with an Apple employee named Roger admitting he’d never seen a case this bad but it does happen.He explained that phones are computers not cameras, and so even without the live photo setting turned on it does take a burst of images from left to right.Roger further explained that at the exact moment the camera went behind her back, Tessa must have raised her hands and so it made a completely different set of images on the other side.Tessa pointed out the line where the photos meet. Picture: InstagramTessa was grateful to finally have an answer. Picture: Instagram“It’s made like an AI decision and it stitched those two photos together,” Tessa recounted of the employee’s explanation.“And one very clever person on Twitter found the exact line on my back, it’s a tiny tiny bit that’s not completely in line and that’s where the photos are stitched together.”The comedian also shared a photo in her Instagram Stories circling the line where the two photos joined.More CoverageMan’s ‘unbelievable’ act at mate’s weddingSister slammed for major wedding faux pas“They also said that Google Pixel – this is not a Google Pixel phone, this is an iPhone – have brought out this new technology where you take multiple photos and it chooses the best photo for you, and iPhone are Beta testing this technology.”She added: “So if you look at the left side, that’s a complete image, if you look at the right side, that’s also a complete image.”Tessa ended her explanation to her social media followers by saying that Apple employee Roger admitted the end result was a “one in a million chance”.",0.039,0.896,0.064,0.9698

Picture: Facebook / Jordan Flom“We have named the triplets, three boys in case you didn’t know,” the dad said. “Locklan means from the lands of lakes. I’m from Minnesota.“Baby B’s name is Wilder Scott. Wilder we just really loved, but then we found out that his family grew up in Wilder, Minnesota.“The name of Baby C is Brisbane Leigh. We might say Bris for short. Leigh is my middle name, and I lived in Brisbane, Australia for six months. “It just meant a lot to me and I jokingly said the name Brisbane once.

Which means he might be a sports player.”The couple asked their followers to tell them what they thought of the names they picked, but asked that they keep the comments “positive”. Many of their followers were shocked at the 'bizarre' name.

7,39,758720349624610,Following the tragic death of Matthew Perry comes questions about the estate he leaves behind and his massive Friends fortune.,2023-11-06 19:20:01,31.0,15,0,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrity-deaths/matthew-perrys-friends-fortune-where-do-his-yearly-30-million-residuals-go-now/news-story/89b859d66259d910a8526b0160b67a49?utm_campaign=EditorialSB&utm_source=News.com.au&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_content=SocialBakers,42,Matthew Perry’s Friends fortune: Where do his yearly $30 million residuals go now?,"Matthew Perry tragically died on October 28, leaving questions behind about what happens to his estate — and his Friends millions. Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Tre Lovell told the New York Post that in the case of a death like Perry’s, there are three options that could happen. “There may be a trust, and that would be administered privately, through his trustee. He could have had a will — that would be administered under [probate] court supervision. If he had neither, there’s a statutory framework put in place, where there’s a listing of his heirs that would get his estate.”Lovell added that if the third option happens, since Perry had no wife or children and his parents are still alive, “They would split his estate. His siblings would be next in line, after the parents. But, since both of his parents are living, they would get it,” he explained. Matthew Perry died on October 28 from an apparent drowning. Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty ImagesPerry — and his Friends co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer — reportedly make $US20 million ($30 million) a year in residuals. The beloved NBC comedy ran for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004.Perry, who struggled with addiction and sobriety for years, died of an apparent drowning in a hot tub at his home in the ritzy Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles.He’s survived by a large family: his actor father, John Bennett Perry, 82, his mother Suzanne, 75, his famous stepfather, Dateline’s Keith Morrison, 76, and his five half-siblings: Caitlin, Emily, Will and Madeline Morrison (who are Suzanne’s kids with Keith) and Maria Perry (who is John Bennett Perry’s daughter with his second wife, Debbie Boyle). Law enforcement sources told TMZ that investigators ran a less in-depth toxicology test on the actor that revealed Perry did not have fentanyl or methamphetamines in his system at the time of his death.Days before his death, Perry shared this photo of himself in a hot tub on Instagram. Picture: InstagramMore tests are currently being conducted as part of the toxicology report. It can take months to establish an official cause of death, which is still “deferred.”Perry’s friend, Athenna Crosby, 25, who was one of the last people to see the Friends star before his death — as the duo dined together just one day before the tragedy — has insisted that he did not relapse. “I think people are speculating that this was a relapse situation. I just want to defend him and say that it was not,” she said, adding that he was “100 per cent sober” and behaving in a way that was “completely normal” during their lunch. Lovell told The Post that if there’s a trust, that information might not be made public, because it’s private. “I would be surprised if there wasn’t some type of estate planning. He’s a famous actor, he’s got business managers, agents, lawyers,” he said. Perry was still receiving residuals for his work on Friends up until his death. Picture: Andrew Lipovsky/Getty Images)Regarding residuals from Friends from syndication and streaming, through SAG-AFTRA, “You can designate who it can go to,” said Lovell. “So, that can be separate from any trust or will. So, there’s a chance he wrote in somebody [to receive that money after his death]. But we just don’t know.”If Perry “wrote in somebody,” it could be a charity, Lovell explained. The Canadian actor, who estimated he spent $US9 million ($13 million) through the years to get sober, eventually achieved sobriety before his death.He also formed the Perry House in 2013 in his former Malibu abode, which was a male sober living facility that operated for two years.Perry starred alongside David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow And Matt Leblanc on Friends from 1994 to 2004. Picture: Getty ImagesOn Friday, pals close to the late Friends star announced that they will establish the Matthew Perry Foundation to aid those battling substance abuse.“The Matthew Perry Foundation is the realisation of Matthew’s enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction,” officials said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight.More CoverageFriends stars’ texts about Perry’s deathMatthew Perry’s ‘mystery woman’ speaks out“It will honour his legacy and be guided by his own words and experiences and driven by his passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible.”Lovell pointed out that since “recovery was a big part of his life, there’s a lot of speculation that if he did designate anybody to receive the assets, it could be some type of charity or [addiction] recovery organisation.”This article originally appeared in New York Post and was reproduced with permission",0.064,0.82,0.116,0.9907

I think there is something drastically wrong,” an angry Mathews told reporters in New Delhi.“In my 15-year career, I’ve never seen a team going down to that level because the umpires also admitted that it’s equipment malfunction, and they could have gone upstairs and checked again.” He added: “I don’t think any other team would do that because it was black and white. It was equipment malfunction, the helmet coming off. It was a big safety issue as well.“Shakib had the option (of recalling me) but he decided to go the other way.” According to laws of cricket, after the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, the incoming player must be ready to receive the ball within two minutes.Angelo Mathews’ timed out dismissal has sparked a spirit of cricket debate. (Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP)On-field umpires Marais Erasmus and Richard Illingworth talked to both teams before the decision was upheld.The 36-year-old Mathews reluctantly trudged off with most spectators appearing bemused by the decision.Mathews said the team has proof of the time it took him to reach the crease and it was less than two minutes and therefore well within the rules.“We will put out a statement later on,” said Mathews.“We have video evidence, footage, everything was looked at. I’m not just coming and saying things here. I’m talking proof.”He said: “Well, as I said, it’s a technicality which needs to be discussed because it’s a World Cup game and what happens if this happens in the last over when you have three or four runs to get in the last wicket. I wasn’t trying to waste time.”Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews speaks with the umpires after he was timed out. (Photo by Sajjad HUSSAIN / AFP).Spirit of cricket debate explodesDebate has erupted over whether the dismissal was in the spirit of the game, with many pointing out Mathews was at his crease just in time but was let down by his helmet.Australian Test batter Usman Khawaja wrote on X: “Angelo made his crease then his helmet strap broke. How is that timed out? “I’m all for timed out if he doesn’t make his crease but this is ridic. No different then a batsman getting to the crease then taking 3 minutes to face up.”Indian legend Gautam Gambhir posted: “Absolutely pathetic what happened in Delhi today! #AngeloMathews.”Others said he could have avoided being timed out by facing his first ball and then immediately calling for a replacement helmet, especially since Al Hasan was bowling spin at the time.Wisden’s Ben Gardner said: “Could Angelo Mathews have just faced up for one ball without a helmet, then delayed and called for a replacement? Yes but, crucially, he didn’t do that.”What makes the Angelo Mathews timed out dismissal so absurd is that if he had faced one ball, then his chinstrap had broken, no-one would have batted even half an eyelid about him taking a minute or two to fix/replace it before the next ball. A ridiculous dismissal.— Andy Zaltzman (@ZaltzCricket) November 6, 2023It is very funny that cricket has all these Laws detailing ways you can be dismissed but itâ€™s considered unacceptably rude to actually enforce them.— Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) November 6, 2023Sometimes cricket really is absurd. And then it reaches a new level of Angelo Matthews timed out absurdity. #SLvBAN— Melinda Farrell (@melindafarrell) November 6, 2023Fourth umpire Adrian Holdstock spoke to Star Sports during the innings break and said, “in the instance this afternoon, the batter wasn’t ready to receive the ball within those two minutes, even before the strap became an issue for him.” But Mathews said: “If you ask the question now, he would have a different answer … I have the video evidence and if anybody wants to contest it, I urge them to.” The dismissal contributed to an acrimonious atmosphere and the players of both teams did not shake hands after the match, which was won by Bangladesh by three wickets and ended Sri Lanka’s slim chances of making the semi-finals.Mathews slammed Bangladesh's captain Shakib Al Hasan.

We are all ambassadors of this beautiful game including the umpires,” Mathews said on not going ahead with the customary handshakes after the match.“If you don’t respect and don’t use common sense than what more you can ask for.” Shakib remained defiant and when asked whether he had any regrets for his actions, the star all-rounder said, “not at all”.More Coverage‘Not feeling great’: Smith in fresh setback‘Oh dear’: World first as batter timed out“One of our fielders came to me and said, if you appeal, the law says he’s out because he hasn’t taken his guard within the time frame,” said Shakib.“So, then I appealed and the umpire asked me whether I’m going to call him back or not. I said ‘I won’t call him back’.” He added: “It’s in the laws. I don’t know if it’s right or wrong, but I had to take a decision to, you know, make sure that my team wins, and whatever I had to do, I have to do it.”",0.055,0.864,0.081,0.9757

There were plenty of iconic fashion moments on the day, including a bright outfit from singer Delta Goodrem, as well as a stunning appearance from Brooke Warne, the daughter of late cricketer Shane Warne, and the Flemington debut of Lady Eliza Spencer and Lady Amelia Spencer, the nieces of late Princess Diana.But there was an unexpected guest spotted trackside, Annie Knight, the Aussie porn star who has dubbed herself Australia’s “most sexually active woman”. However her surprise attendance wasn’t without drama.The 26-year-old has risen to social media prominence in recent weeks after revealing she quit her career in marketing to work fulltime on OnlyFans, and is now raking in about $150,000 a month selling explicit content.Annie Knight, an Australian porn star, made an unexpected appearance at Melbourne Cup. Picture: Instagram/AnnieKnightShe scoffed at claims she’d ‘begged’ for an invite into the Birdcage. Picture: Instagram/AnnieKnightBut the Gold Coast woman took time out of her busy filming schedule to head trackside, where she was reported to have “begged” to be allowed inside the Birdcage, a claim she later denied on Instagram. “Begged to get in here guys,” she sarcastically captioned a screenshot of a report which alleged she “spent days begging industry guests and brands for an invite”.Knight opted for a pink dress while enjoying the perks of the exclusive members area, which she paired with chunky gold jewellery and gold heels.Brooke Warne at the Schwepps marquee.

It’s like South African style, too. Beachy, relaxed, feminine.” The two looked stunning in red – Lady Eliza in an off-the-shoulder gown with an Ezara J metal veil, while Lady Amelia wore a shorter dress with a floral Stephanie Browne crown. ‘We love Australian fashion,’ Lady Amelia told Vogue Australia.

One of Wilkinson’s most high-profile clients – and close friends – Rebecca Judd was at the receiving end on Cup Day last year after some claimed her red ensemble showed too much flesh. The 40-year-old wore a mini-dress from Australian designer Effie Kats while attending the G.H. Mumm marquee inside the Birdcage that many fans described as “stunning” and “perfection”.Rebecca Judd was on the receiving end of criticism for her Melbourne Cup outfit in 2022.

He told reporters on his way out that the homes of both NSW couple Steph and Gian and sisters Eliza and Liberty had sold for “too much.” Portelli bought both of those for well over $1 million over their reserve, delivering Steph and Gian a record-breaking Block win of $1.75 million. Asked why he didn’t fight harder to secure any of the other three houses, Wallis told Domain: “They’re junk.”The outlet reported that his sister – who can be seen near him at every Block auction, looking after his dog – expanded on his remarks to reporters: “[They’re] high maintenance for investment properties, which is what we have to consider.”WA couple Kyle and Leslie’s home sold at auction giving them a respectable $130,000 profit, while SA’s Kristy and Brett were left fuming after their auctioneer could only nudge their property $65,000 over reserve. Nervous about ending up with a similarly small profit, Queensland’s Leah and Ash pulled their house from auction before it had reached reserve, and it is still on the market. Also present at the auctions was comedian Dave Hughes, who claimed on-air yesterday that Wallis’ giant opening bid for winners Steph and Gian’s house had actually been an error.Wallis had started the auctions with a bang when his first bid was a whopping $650,000 over the couple’s reserve. Portelli quickly trounced him though, adding another million dollars on top of that in a single winning bid. “He has meant to say $2,999,000 and he said $3,999,000 – that was a mistake from Danny. That mistake got the ball rolling,” Hughes revealed on 2DayFM’s Hughesy, Ed & Erin.Portelli said Wallis had “stuffed up.”Appearing as a guest on the program, Adrian Portelli confirmed that his rival had “stuffed up” his opening bid: “I saw him backtrack, realise what he’d done, and I thought I’d put the nail in the coffin.”The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record)Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitMore CoverageBlock winners reveal secret behind winBizarre Block auction reveals huge problemKyle and Leslie, house 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.Leah and Ash, House 2: Reserve of $2.97 million not met, passed in at auction.Read related topics:The Block",0.09,0.798,0.112,0.9441

Picture: InstagramTaraja and his daughters died in the crash on Tuesday night while son Kisasi was rushed to hospital.His grandmother confirmed the 10-year-old died of his injuries four days later.His daughter Sundari, nicknamed Sunny, was among those killed. Picture: InstagramAs was his son, Kisasi. Picture: InstagramTaraja’s three-year-old daughter Shazia survived and is in the hospital recovering from minor injuries.Another 15-year-old girl who was in the crash was barely hurt.Police confirmed that Taraja, 41, was behind the wheel when the car slammed into the trailer, but the cause of the crash remains unclear.A dedicated athlete, Taraja earned stuntman roles in Avengers: Endgame and Avengers: Infinity War.Also among his 78 listed credits on IMDb were dozens of art department roles in films like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Fast & Furious 7.But outside of his accolades, Taraja is remembered by his mother Akili as a dedicated family man and father of her grandchildren.“All who knew and met him know how special Taraja was,” she wrote in a heartwrenching post announcing his death.“He had a deep capacity for love and loved his children more than all.“He loved his martial arts, motorcycles, and all things related to filmmaking.“He had a very droll yet wicket sense of humour & could be as cornball corny as can be.”Akili said all of her son’s best qualities would be seen in Sundari, who was called Sunny by her family.She shared pictures of Taraja smiling proudly with his children by his side and wrote: “Oh God! I can’t believe they’re gone.”Filmmaker Ava DuVernay also dedicated a post to the talented stuntman who she described as “regal.”“He walked like a king. And to me, always acted like one,” she wrote on Instagram.“Taraja was the first to say yes. Yes, I’ll do my real job and then jump into this wild scene playing a tough guy with a gun for you.“From there – everyone else said yes too. He was that kind of person.“Bless his soul. Bless his memory. Bless his loved ones and the many comrades he leaves here as he journeys on.”Taraja is seen centre right in Black Panther. Picture: Marvel‘Artistic passion’Taraja’s cousin Pharaoh Hardee recounted the moment the future superstar stuntman found his passion for film and entertainment.He said his “little brother” moved to Atlanta as a young boy, and started helping Hardee produce music videos.A child of a painter and photographer, creativity was in Taraja’s blood, but it wasn’t until these shared moments that art started to take root.“When he saw what I was doing with music videos and things of that nature, he asked me, ‘How did you get into that?’” he told USA Today.“Being able to see things come into fruition like you do in behind-the-scenes work can really spark something that you didn’t even really know was there if you have any type of artistic passion.”Despite his artistic accomplishments, Hardee stressed that his most treasured contribution to the world was his children.Taraja’s training partner and close friend Tony Tucci said he would even bring his kids to hang out at their martial arts gym.“He was always a family man,” he said.“They would come and sit and watch him train, and they would jump in and start training too.”Taraja was an excitable person, and couldn’t stop talking about his involvement in Black Panther when he got cast, according to Tucci.In the wake of his cousin’s death, Hardee said Taraja’s memory can be honoured by making the most of each day.“Don’t take it [life] for granted. I made sure I told him I loved him when we had a talk on the phone,” he said.“He told me he loved me too. I don’t have any regret in that sense.More CoverageSad details emerge on actor’s sudden deathIconic Australian actor dead at 85“Don’t take things for granted or people for granted, especially your family.”A GoFundMe created to raise money for the family has amassed over $80,000 as of Sunday night.This article originally appeared in The US Sun and was reproduced with permission.",0.074,0.737,0.189,0.9988

We have been deprived. Usually, when an Aussie threatens to retire, they never do.Yet, Hewitt gave us no warning and just stopped attending the Melbourne Cup, and just like an overconfident white man on Tinder with a tribal tattoo, she has ghosted us. Bec Hewitt was Melbourne Cup Fashion.She loved some giant head gear. Picture: AAP Image/Julian SmithI haven’t seen such betrayal since Ricki-Lee Coulter left the Young Divas, and Jessica Mauboy had to throw her hair in an extravagant up-do and pick up the pop pieces. Here’s the thing: Bec Hewitt was Melbourne Cup Fashion, and she was awful at it, and that is what made it so good. The problem with the fashion today is all the Influencers shop at the same places and buy the same $700 Rebecca Vallance dress, and everyone looks good during the iconic Melbourne day. Sure, you might not love whatever cut-out Pip Edwards is wearing, but she still looks nice. Everyone looks nice and it is as predictable as David Campbell’s annual performance at Carols in the Domain. Bec Judd has done her best to hold down the Melbourne Cup forte but, much like her tenure on The Amazing Race, it isn’t enough to save a sinking ship. We need Hewitt back, because she bought the drama. Now this is fashion. Picture: Paul McConnell/Getty Images2006 was the best Melbourne Cup year ever. Picture: supplied.She’d pop on a pair of white pedal pushers, strap a fascinator to her head, and she’d be off to the races. It was tacky, it was shocking, and it was everything we all deserved. Did it look like she’s rustled through a Supre sale bin to find her outfit? Yes. Hewitt would land on the worst-dressed list; people would sneer at her and crack jokes, but she always had the last laugh because she was the one everyone was talking about. I think she always understood that the Melbourne Cup wasn’t meant to be taken that seriously. It isn’t a family wedding where you’ll have to face that cousin who has her life together, so you need to look conservative but still gorgeous; it is the races. It is just an event where a bunch of men in chinos pretend to understand horse racing for a day and usually someone falls over in the muddy grass.It isn’t that serious. This was a vibe. Picture: Jason EdwardsShe’s looking incredible. Picture: AAP Image/Dan HimbrechtsIt is a chance to wear something fun, and she took full advantage. She’d wear a ridiculous hat that looked like it’d been stolen from Guy Sebestian’s fedora collection and she’d look incredible. One year, she even wore a cape, and it was floral! Lleyton would accompany her in a boring suit, understanding that it is his job to let her shine, and she’d be the talk of the town. It is the kind of icon behaviour we don’t see enough of anymore. Everyone’s so invested in looking hot and sexy that it has become dull. There’s no denying that Hewitt is gorgeous, but her fashion looks were never particularly sexy. She was too busy experimenting.It always looked like she’d popped into Spotlight and picked a fabric that should have only been used for curtains and decided to wear the hell out of it.

Photos taken only minutes apart at Saturday’s Golden Eagle show the look in all its glory.“He wore it to formal and the races last year,” one fed-up girlfriend said of her boyfriend’s outfit at Rosehill racetrack.“It’s the formula. It doesn’t even fit him properly, but he still wears it.”Zach Miller, the 22-year-old boyfriend in question, was blindsided by the sartorial swipe but did not dispute the allegations.“It’s my brother’s,” he confessed.For the record, his school formal was four years ago.Zach Miller has been borrowing The Uniform off his brother for years. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auThe Uniform in all its glory. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auMr Miller’s mates said they were tired of seeing their friend sport the same outfit at every event. Mainly because he looked identical to hundreds of fellow guests. “I swear to god, at least 750 blokes come here wearing beige chinos, white shirts, blue blazers,” one of them said. “I reckon they all go to a meeting and agree on wearing it. They all meet up beforehand and come out to the races. Then they walk past each other and high-five.”Fish in a barrel.The espresso martini adds a touch of class to The Uniform. Picture: NCA NewsWIRE / Monique HarmerShe is the moment. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auNicole Adolphe, head of style at The Iconic, said it’s no surprise. After all, men love two things: quoting Anchorman. And dressing like they’re in a secret club.“Men aren’t as concerned about the possibility that every guy in their circle might be sporting the same ensemble,” she said.“On the contrary, they appreciate safety in numbers, as it reinforces the notion that they too have chosen the right look for the occasion.”Sales figures from the online Aussie retailer show this year’s top-selling colour in the blazer category is navy blue, while the most-sold pant is the chino.“It’s simple, easy, and cheap,” said Matt Staples, a 29-year-old financial planner who was wearing The Uniform at Saturday’s races.He purchased the outfit five years ago and it quickly became his go-to. He said “probably about 99% of guys” at all events he attends are wearing the same look.They were quoting Anchorman when this photo was taken. Media Mode/news.com.auWhy wear anything else? Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auOriginal. Unique. Never been done before. Media Mode/news.com.auFashion designer Alex Perry said it’s a classic look that can be easily fumbled.“It’s not that the items are bad in themselves – it’s the execution,” he said.“If you’re gonna do it, get a sharp, beautiful blazer and clean, crisp pants. Iron them!”But this memo from Mr Perry isn’t being received by some fellas, who opt to see The Uniform less as an elegant look and more as the sartorial equivalent of a spare parts car yard.“Honestly, this is a very mismatched outfit,” Will Borton, 20, said at the Golden Eagle. “I’ve got my dad’s tie, my sister’s boyfriend’s shirt, and my brother’s blazer. I’ve got my own pants.”Taking a rest to order more beige chinos from The Iconic. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auThe outfit equivalent of a spare parts car yard. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auTried and tested. Picture: Media Mode/news.com.auCelebrity stylist Donny Galella, who’s dressing singer Samantha Jade and model Erin Holland for today’s Melbourne Cup celebrations, said The Uniform has become “the little black dress” for blokes. He suggested experimenting with other colours like sage green and rusty reds.But if you’ve already left the house wearing The Uniform this morning, Lisa Bean, senior buyer at The Iconic, recommended a quick zhuzh by rolling up the sleeves and undoing a few buttons.“If you prefer sticking to The Uniform, accessories like sunglasses and shoes play a pivotal role and enhance the individuality of your chinos and blazer ensemble,” she said.At the very least, make sure to give The Uniform the occasional rinse.Darcy Kelleher, 34, wasn’t even sure his outfit had been cleaned since its last whirl around the races.“It’s been in my closet for a while. I just woke up this morning and put it on,” he said at the Golden Eagle.He has owned his version of The Uniform for six years. There was a tear at the elbow and the shoulders were covered in dust. His fly was undone.“It’s timeless,” he said.Read related topics:Melbourne",0.022,0.879,0.099,0.9964

While this may seem like a boon for the sheep industry, it has created significant challenges for farmers and consumers.The oversupply of sheep has resulted in plummeting prices for farmers, causing concerns within the industry. To manage the surplus, some farmers are taking extreme measures, including culling their sheep on the farm rather than selling them.This drastic drop in prices comes as a surprise, considering that just two years ago, Australian sheep prices were at record highs. RELATED: Worrying sign milk prices could soarA surplus of sheep in Australia is causing low prices for farmers and potential savings for lamb shoppers. Picture: SuppliedAs the world’s largest exporter of sheep meat, Australia faces the challenge of managing this sudden oversupply. About 70 per cent of the lamb produced in Australia is sold overseas. According to Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the low farmgate prices are beginning to affect local retail prices. Nationally, retail lamb prices have decreased by 9.5 per cent compared to the previous year.MLA spokesman Steve Bignell explains that the price flow from sale yard prices to retail typically takes about eight months for cattle and sheep. Australia faces the challenge of managing this sudden oversupply of lamb. Picture: Zoe PhillipsWith lamb prices historically dropping in the spring, consumers can expect further decreases in retail prices.Angus Harris, Co-CEO of Harris Farm Markets, also anticipates that lower farmgate prices for lamb and beef will soon translate into reduced retail prices for consumers. He further cited that the delay in these price reductions reaching consumers is partly attributed to a shortage of meat processing workers, leading to higher labour costs in the supply chain.But why are prices falling?The past three years have witnessed higher-than-average rainfall in most of Australia's farming regions, leading to abundant grass and forage for livestock. These favourable conditions allowed farmers to increase their sheep herds, resulting in a remarkable 23 per cent growth in the national sheep flock since 2020.The ability of sheep to breed rapidly contributes to the current oversupply issue, leading to the largest number of sheep, both for meat and wool production, in Australia since 2007.Livestock agent Martin Simmons, based in Dubbo, New South Wales, noted that after the recent drought, farmers were eager to rebuild their flocks quickly. RELATED: Shock claims about major Aussie industryThe ability of sheep to breed rapidly contributes to the current oversupply issue. Picture: Dean MarzollaThe lamb market experienced a boom due to the abundance of paddock feed and the global demand for meat. By June 2021, some lamb prices reached record highs, hovering around $10 per kilogram. However, by September 2023, this boom had collapsed, and prices were back to a modest $3 to $4 per kilogram.This price drop represented a 40 per cent year-on-year decrease in lamb prices, reaching their lowest point since 2014. Old sheep sold as mutton witnessed an even more significant decline, nearly 80 per cent lower than in the past 15 years.

Meat and Livestock Australia estimates that about 33,000 sheep farmers operate in the country, but there is limited data regarding those who resort to culling their sheep on the farm. Industry groups have reported instances where farmers, unable to cover the cost of transportation to sale yards or meat processing facilities, have had no option but to euthanise their sheep.

Over 28 months, the team documented multiple observations, with photographs and video footage of the specimen swimming in a creek in New South Wales’ Northern Tablelands.Lou Streeting, one of the researchers, emphasised the rarity of this find, saying, “Platypus are one of the world’s most extraordinary animals. “Many people may never encounter this unique mammal in the wild, and we were fortunate to observe and capture footage of this rare white platypus.”While the footage was captured from a distance and the encounters were fleeting, the distinct white colouration of the platypus against the creek’s brown water makes for a striking sight.“We feel especially fortunate to have encountered such an unusual colour morph.”RELATED: Rare white whale spotted off Aussie coastUnique white Platypus found in Aussie creek prompts conservation concerns. Picture: Louise StreetingThe unusual white platypusSearching through historical records, Streeting found only 12 instances of albino or leucistic platypus dating back to 1835. The unique platypus she documented is believed to be leucistic, a condition characterised by reduced pigmentation due to environmental or genetic factors. While leucism is rare in platypus, it is more frequently observed in certain bird species in urban areas, notably magpies and kookaburras.The discovery of the white platypus has reignited concerns for the overall conservation of these remarkable creatures. The leucistic platypus observed by the University of New England researchers. Picture: Louise StreetingThe Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) urges authorities to provide better protection for the platypus.Platypuses typically have a brown colouration, which helps them blend seamlessly into the muddy creeks they inhabit, making them challenging to observe. One effective way to contribute to platypus conservation is by participating in the “platy-project.” This nationwide citizen science initiative encourages people to visit their local creeks or rivers, find a serene spot along the bank, and attempt to spot a platypus while documenting their observations. By recording the locations where platypuses reside, we can gain valuable insights into this incredible species and take measures to prevent further population decline.Notably, there are regions within the platypus’ habitat where sightings have never been recorded or observed for an extended period. These knowledge gaps pose significant challenges to conservation efforts.Platypuses typically have a brown colouration, which helps them blend seamlessly into the muddy creeks they inhabit.

The survey was conducted from June 7 to June 12 this year and took place online, with a cross-section of 1000 adults from the US and Canada aged 18 and over, who’ve travelled by air in the past three years.It comes after a video posted to TikTok, and then to X, formerly Twitter, went viral online after one passenger reclined their seat.In the clip, two American passengers could be seen engaging in a heated argument upon landing after a frustrated woman claimed another passenger had pushed her seat the entire flight.The button that is often the cause of most flight arguments. Picture: iStock“The whole trip she pushed my seat,” the fed-up American woman told a male passenger in the row behind. “You seen it. You know she did.”Rising from her seat, the woman yelled repeatedly: “I’m allowed to put my seat back.”Ian Miles Cheong, who posted the video to the platform, wrote: “She’s allowed to put her seat back. You don’t get to kick it repeatedly just because you want more space.”Many praised the woman for standing her ground.“If the seat is reclinable, recline it,” one person wrote.“You are allowed! Period! You want space in front of you instead of pushing the seat, buy a seat with extra space or get your ass to business class. Reclining was put there for a reason,” another said. That traveller added: “She was patient enough to wait till flight landed”.But others claimed there was an unwritten rule that you should not recline your seat, especially on a short-haul flight.Some travellers blamed the airlines and said they should scrap the ability to recline altogether.“Putting your seat back in coach is an unspoken thing most people don’t do. It’s really the airline’s fault because they’ve made coach so cramped and tight that putting the seat back shouldn’t even be an option,” one person wrote.If you were to ask an Aussie, 41.1 per cent have a problem with it and surprisingly, it’s something many Aussies refuse to do.According to one survey, 54.2 per cent of Aussie travellers won’t recline their plane seat, and according to another, 88 per cent of passengers from the US and Canada will engage in the act.According to recent research conducted by Compare the Market, 54.2 per cent of Aussie travellers said they won’t recline their own seat., while it was a little lower in Canada at 47.6 per cent and in the States it was 46.5 per cent.In Australia, just over half the people surveyed claimed to avoid reclining their seats to respect other passengers.But, there’s still a chunk of Aussies (29.2 per cent) who would still recline their seats – dirty looks or not.While it is what they are designed to do, a fivethirtyeight poll showed that four in 10 people think it’s “rude”.A clip went viral last week of a woman in a heated argument with the person behind them after she reclined her seat. Picture: XMeanwhile, the survey also touched on the dreaded middle seat – and the great armrest debate.It revealed 67.7 per cent of flyers say passengers in the middle seat should get one armrest.It was a similar verdict from the Kayak survey, with 57 per cent of travellers agreeing you are not allowed to claim both armrests just because you’re seated in the middle. However, according to a news.com.au poll, 69 per cent (of 13005 voters) agreed middle seat passengers should be entitled to both armrests.Earlier this year, one woman sparked a heated debate when she revealed a passenger wasn’t impressed when she reclined her seat as it meant she couldn’t use her laptop.She took to TikTok to share her story while on a six-hour flight.“So I recline my seat and the girl behind me IMMEDIATELY tells me that she can’t use her laptop if I recline, didn’t ask me to unrecline – more of a statement with the expectation,” the woman said.“So I put the seat back to normal although I want it reclined for this six-hour flight. Let it go?”More CoverageCommon plane secret is actually a mythAussie’s ‘citizenship hack’ sparks furyThe clip was viewed by more than 620,000 with users divided about who was in the right.In August, a passenger on a 12-hour flight refused to let the woman in front of her recline her seat — telling her to “respect the person behind you”.Last year, another woman went viral after she told the Fitzy & Wippa radio show she finds the move “inconsiderate” and immediately exacts revenge by facing all the vents in her fellow passenger’s direction.",0.052,0.889,0.059,0.4046

I’m not sure why I behave this way but I criticise him a lot over everything from how he dresses to the fact he doesn’t do enough around the house. He’s a very placid man and the more I nag him, the quieter he gets. I begin each day promising myself that I will pick at him less but then before I know what I’m saying a scathing remark about him is coming out of my mouth. Why am I behaving this way toward him and how can I stop?ANSWER: It’s hard to acknowledge where we’re messing up in our relationships. I appreciate your awareness and acknowledgment of your actions here.There are always good reasons we act the way we do. It isn’t because you’re a terrible person. We need to understand what’s driving your actions and then give you tools for change to prevent this permanently damaging your relationship.I really love my husband but I can’t stop picking fights with him. Picture: iStockCriticism will damage your relationshipCriticism is one of four common communication styles, known as ‘The Four Horsemen’ that predict the end of a relationship. Criticism will always damage your relationship, even if you don’t intend it to.My concern is that your husband isn’t just placid. It’s that he’s actually conflict avoidant. While it might seem like he’s just becoming quieter, my fear is that he’s actually building resentment and distance with every sharp remark.Avoiding criticising your husband doesn’t mean that you never share your concerns with him. There are ways you can learn to share that will make it easier for him to hear and that won’t damage the relationship.Changing your communication to avoid criticism will take some effort, self awareness and practice. Instead of picking at your partner, you’ll need to learn to slow down, connect to your emotions and then speak differently.My concern is that your husband isn’t just placid. It’s that he’s actually conflict avoidant. Picture: iStockOur actions are driven by emotions While it would be easy for me to tell you to change your communication, that’s almost impossible without a deeper understanding of what’s going on emotionally for you.We are emotionally driven beings – even those of us who consider ourselves ‘logical’. Most of the time, our emotions are unconscious. We spring to action before we’ve really had a chance to notice which emotions are driving our actions. When we gain awareness of our emotions, we also gain control of them. Go slowly for more understandingFor us to understand the emotions that are unconsciously driving our actions, we need to go slowly. Imagine yourself back in one of those moments right before you pick at or criticise your husband. What do you notice happens in your body? Our body is the doorway in which to begin to feel and name our emotions.What emotion goes with that? Go slowly. We often feel what are known as ‘secondary emotions’ first. These are less vulnerable emotions like anger or frustration that protect us from the harder to feel emotions like sadness, fear and shame.There are emotions inside of you that are driving you acting out. It might be how you feel about yourself, how you’re feeling in your relationship or something you feel about your partner.My educated guess is that there is some kind of fear here. I guess that there is some kind of fear here. Perhaps fear that he isn’t really there for you. Picture: iStockPerhaps fear about what your partner is doing. Perhaps fear that he isn’t really there for you. Research shows that when women feel disconnected to their partners throughout the day, they’re more likely to share their concerns in a harsh way when they reconnect in the evenings. With this deeper awareness, you can then change how you’re communicating. This is the premise of really effective couples therapy.The ‘antidote’ to criticismOnce you know what your emotions are, you can then use the ‘antidote to criticism’ when you’re communicating.The antidote to criticism has three steps:I feel …About what …More CoverageWife rages about common husband problemBig problem ‘many men’ have with wifeI need …First, share your underlying emotion with your husband. Then tell him what it’s in relation to. Then tell him how he can be your hero, what you need him to do.Again, this takes practice, but it can make an enormous difference to your relationship in the long term.",0.166,0.754,0.08,-0.9976

Picture: TikTokIn Australia, McDonald’s has also admitted increasing prices, after Aussies claimed “Macca’s is way more expensive” than it had ever been previously. “Like all businesses we are operating in a higher-cost environment, which does impact the cost of running great restaurants in communities across Australia,” a spokesperson told news.com.au in June.“We will always work hard to provide our customers with great value.” However the latest price hike admission has left Macca’s fans around the world furious, with many taking to social media to express their anger. One fast-food diner from Connecticut recently shared their shock at discovering a Big Mac meal now costs $US18 ($A27.65) at his local Macca’s.“These McDonald’s prices are nuts right???” a post by Sam Learner on X, formerly known as Twitter, read.A photo of the menu appeared alongside it, showing various burgers at the shock price. ‘These McDonald’s prices are nuts right?’. Picture: Sam Learner/XAnother burger fan revealed they’d paid $US16 ($A24.60) for a “happy meal”.“So, I understand there’s a labour shortage, wage increases, and a number of other factors, but $16? $16 for a burger, a large fry, and a drink? It’s just crazy,” Christopher Olive, an influencer with more than 400,000 followers, shared in a TikTok video. In the clip, he shows the receipt for his purchase, proving how much his order cost. Both posts have garnered a huge reaction, with customers expressing their disappointment at the rising prices, suggesting the burger giant is no longer affordable for many.“I remember when a big Mac meal was $2.99 I’m that old,” one remarked. “If I’m spending $20, I’m going to a better place than McDonald’s,” another agreed. As one declared: “It’s officially not convenient or affordable anymore.” Christopher Olive paid $US16 ($A24.60) for a ‘happy meal’, labelling it ‘crazy’. Picture: TikTok/Christopher OliveLocally there have been similar gripes from Australians, though it’s worth noting, it is hard to compare prices efficiently due to the fact each McDonald’s is a franchise, meaning individual owners all charge slightly differently for the same food items.More CoverageFury at woman’s ‘irritating’ Macca’s orderFury as Macca’s scraps popular menu item“It’s insane, Macca’s is more expensive than sit down restaurants for the same quantity of food,” one Aussie lamented on Reddit recently.“A cheeseburger cost me $5 today, but I remember when they were only three bucks,” another commented.McDonald’s Australia hasn’t released its annual sales figures for 2023 yet, but reported a record high of $2bn last year.Read related topics:TikTok",0.052,0.871,0.077,0.8992

He wasn’t happy.“So there was a certain amount of professional suspicion, shall we say,” he laughed.Preston said the pair quickly sorted out their issues and he now considers Mehigan to be “one of my most trusted friends”.Former MasterChef judges Matt Preston and Gary Mehigan.

Dave Hughes at The Block auction.The first auction was the biggest of the day, with Steph and Gian’s house racing out of the gates with an opening bid from Wallis some $650,000 over the reserve.Incredibly, Hughes, who was standing near Wallis and his “people,” claimed on-air today that the bid had been rather a large error on Wallis’ part.“He has meant to say $2,999,000 and he said $3,999,000 – that was a mistake from Danny. That mistake got the ball rolling,” he revealed on 2DayFM’s Hughesy, Ed & Erin this morning. Appearing as a guest on the program, Portelli confirmed that his rival had “stuffed up” his opening bid: “I saw him backtrack, realise what he’d done, and I thought I’d put the nail in the coffin.” From there, the auction took another dramatic turn when a young woman in the crowd collapsed and was taken away in an ambulance to receive medical attention.It was later revealed the woman was a registered bidder on Queensland couple Leah and Ash’s home – later on in the finale, with one of their interested buyers in hospital, the pair chose to pass in their home before it reached reserve. Hughes revealed he played a key role as the action unfolded. Last night’s auctions became a showdown between Portelli (left) and Wallis (right). Picture: Supplied/Channel 9“I actually caught the woman who collapsed – me and one other bloke, the bloke from consumer affairs. I was the one who stopped the auction,” he said. “I said, ‘We’ve got to stop the auction, this woman has collapsed.’”Portelli also revealed the tactic behind his bizarre choice to bid against himself during Eliza and Liberty’s auction, repeatedly raising the house price by $100,000 despite already having the highest bid.Hughesy bought Block contestants Josh Barker and Elyse Knowles’ house in 2017. Source: Channel NINE“It was a bit of a tactic to scare everyone off so we don’t get into a bidding war … it was more just a chance to have a bit of fun and showpony,” he admitted.He said he was “out to prove a point” with his major cash splash at this year’s auctions, after being “absolutely shredded by the public” after last year’s finale.Portelli’s arrival at last year’s auctions, where he bought Omar and Oz’s house for a massive $1.58 million over reserve, led to viewer speculation his purchase had been pre-organised to deliver that team a win. Portelli fiercely denied those claims, and later offered the house as a prize via his online lottery business.

Picture: Supplied/Tom RobinsonThe class involves strength training, HINT cardio, mobility and flexibility training, and the burn many have come to love from the field of pilates. “The program starts with a full body warm-up followed by a mobility flow. Following that, three distinctive working sets: standing work; plank/side bodywork; supine glute and abdominal work,” Simon told news.com.au. The workout involves core and stability training using single leg balancing for an extended period of time and combining exercises to target three dimensions of movement.“The beauty of the program is that it can be done to any tempo, and the fact that it is an extended working set of 60-90 seconds per exercise combination, each participant can simply focus on their own execution within that working duration,” Simon said.“We have seen older clients starting out gentle with smaller range of motions and gradually introducing bigger ones in time and substituting the more high impact moves with strengthening alternatives.”He said that apart from the three main functions of fitness – strength, cardio and mobility – people also get the benefit of standing balance and mobility skills, in a sense that is very similar to dancing.The workout focuses on building stability. Picture: Supplied/Tom RobinsonSimon said the class was incredibly beneficial to those who were wanting to work on their stability.“Not only just the burn, but also that foundation. Clients have already reported improvements on range of movement and motor skills,” Simon said.“I envision The BBE to be something that fills in the gaps in that market and something that can be easily shared and taught to other fitness professionals out there.”ROAD TESTI tried out the Best Burn Ever at the Flow Athletic studio in Paddington, Sydney, and was so excited to take part in it. I may not be an ageing adult just yet but my balance is absolutely shocking. It’s something I have been trying to work on through pilates and barre classes, so this seemed like a logical next step.First off, this class is hard in the best possible way. It’s meant to be challenging but you don’t walk away feeling miserable about yourself. If anything, you’re driven to do better next time. It is definitely one instructors encourage you to take at your own pace. There are different levels of difficulty and you can level up and down depending on your needs.As with everything, the class starts with a warm up before beginning to challenge you with different movements such as elevating one leg on a weight while doing various squats and pliés to activate your glutes and core to encourage balance.The class I attended had people of all ages in it. Picture: Supplied/Tom RobinsonIt’s fun! The vibe is amazing, the music is pumping and it definitely feels more like a dance class rather than a serious pilates class.More Coverage‘Unnecessary’ fitness trend thousands loveClass pilates lovers need to tryUsually, I’d track the workout on my Apple Watch to share how many calories were burned but this class isn’t about that. It’s about something so much more important. Although, a sweat was definitely worked up during this workout. Make no mistake about that.Looking around the class, it was a mix of men and women, young and old, with varying levels of fitness but everyone had a component they struggled with. It just goes to show how everyone needs to improve this part of their fitness journey.It is definitely a workout I will be recommending to friends – I agree with Simon, who created the workout, that many people often overlook the importance of stability training. It was good to see a workout that really hammers the message home.",0.033,0.777,0.19,0.999

The boys, who were both rear-seat passengers, were reportedly thrown about 5m from the crash site.CCTV footage of the crash, which is too graphic to show in full, shows the moment the car leaves the road, before smashing through a small tree in front of a home and ploughing into a power pole, splitting the car in two. The rear of the vehicle ends up at the top of a home’s driveway.The sedan was split in two by the impact of the crash.

He returns to check on the child who had been thrown from the car, before putting his hands on his head and running away.Locals could later be seen trying to help the Braydan and Kaine, before covering their bodies with blankets.NSW Police are investigating the crash and the events leading up to it as they hunt for the two men who ran from the wreck that Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden said was “clearly avoidable”.Mr McFadden told reporters on Monday police were also searching for a third person who was riding a dirt bike that was seen travelling near the Ford at the time of the crash.“We are looking for that driver to present themself so we can speak to him. We do not know what role, if any, he has played in the crash, but it is certainly an active line of investigation,” he said.He urged the pair who fled the vehicle to come forward, warning: “we will find them”.“They just need to present themselves to a police station, so we can engage with them and they can assist us with the inquiries and work out how this tragic situation unfolded,” Mr McFadden said.Police and detectives descended upon the Ashcroft street to investigate the fatal crash.

The Academy Award nominated actor got his boogie on at Paul McCartney’s concert on the Gold Coast. Law, 50, was dancing and singing, and it looked like he was having the time of his life. He was looking low-key in a black top and jeans and dancing to the banger Hey Jude. It was exactly what you’d want any Jude to do in such a situation. Jude Law is having the time of his life.

So there’s no denying it was fun to see the huge star enjoying the show alongside a bunch of excited Aussies. So how did we lure the movie star here? Well, Law is in town filming the new Ron Howard movie Eden. Not much is known about the upcoming blockbuster, but it is set to be a survival thriller. Law has been one of the acting world’s most famous faces for decades, and he’s had one of the most public and messy celebrity relationships. Jude and Sienna dated for years. Picture: Steve Finn/Getty ImagesThey were a 2000s power couple. Picture: David Westing/Getty ImagesHe famously dated ‘it’ girl Sienna Miller in the early 2000s, although they ultimately broke up after Law had an affair in 2005. In unusual celebrity fashion, he publicly admitted to his infidelity. “I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I’ve hurt Sienna and the people most close to us,” Law said.Miller and Law split but ended up getting back together in 2008 and ultimately broke up again around 2011. He is a huge star. Picture: Alberto E.

Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed, let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it’s just the last thing you want to do,” she toldThe Daily Beast in 2020. Since then, Law has kept a much lower profile but opened up in 2018 about what he dislikes most about being so incredibly famous. “I think the thing I loathe is that you subconsciously are aware of, say, how you look or how you act, even when you know you’re not in the public eye,” he said.

Picture: Supplied/Channel 9Midway through the auction, when things weren’t going to plan, Brett got in a frosty confrontation with Inan as they convened privately.“What the hell?” Brett said. “You mentioned high twos, we spoke about starting the bid at $3.2m? Mate, I can’t believe how that’s just gone.” Host Scott Cam even had a crack, telling Inan, “You probably set the scene by mentioning $2.9m at the start. That got in everyone’s head. We just don’t mention anything. We know what the others went for.”Further, Kristy and Brett were frustrated Inan appeared to annoy big spender Adrian Portelli by referring to his lucrative lottery business as a “raffle” during the auction, which the multi-millionaire later admitted turned him off making a bid.“We do spend a lot of time, money and effort educating people about the nature of our business and unfortunately people like that... There’s a big, legal fine line between a raffle and what we do, so when we do hear the word raffle, we sort of shun that,” Portelli told Hughesy, Ed & Erin Monday morning. “It sort of put a negative spin on it, [and] I did back away a tad because of that.” Kristy and Brett had the lowest earnings on this year’s season. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9The problems didn’t end there, with Kristy and Brett also fuming that Inan declared the house was on the market, which essentially gave away their reserve price.Speaking after the show, Inan claimed a Consumer Affairs representative was on his case during the auction, urging him to state when the house was on the market.“With Consumer Affairs [Victoria] in attendance it’s very hard not to answer truthfully,” he said to Domain after the auction. “You can sometimes say, ‘Look I’ll answer you when I’m ready.’ But the reality is, with Consumer Affairs there – and they’re knowing what the paperwork says – it’s very, very hard to do anything but tell the truth.“They actually followed me around during the break and said, ‘You’d better make sure you reiterate that it’s on the market – I don’t think everyone heard you’.”That aside, Inan claimed there was simply “no money left in the room” following the first two sales, which were both bought by Portelli.He said buyers “didn’t see the value” in Houses 1 [Kyle and Leslie], 2 [Leah and Ash] and 3 [Kristy and Brett].“When I spoke to some of the buyers that didn’t bid on our properties they said they didn’t see the value in our homes, full stop,” he said.“It had nothing to do with whether they were cheap or affordable on the day. They just didn’t like them.”‘They didn’t see the value.’ Inan argued the poor result wasn’t his fault.Following the finale, there was an outpouring of support for Inan on social media, with thousands of viewers taking to a post of Kristy and Brett on The Block’s official Instagram page to say they “felt sorry” for the agent.“Am I the only one who feels really sorry for this estate agent?” one person wrote. “He’s only human and he’s on TV. It’s easy to just slip up when you’re nervous. I think it is so wrong showing someone being grilled by 3 people while they stand there alone in front of a camera. Poor guy, at the end of the day if people actually wanted their property and wanted to support them they’d be buying it.”Another added, “The way they spoke to the real estate agent shows why they are so undeserving of money.”A third wrote, “Not the agents fault. Price is indicative of the attitude displayed throughout the season. No responsibility and no ownership from this couple. The first buyer spent $5mil and said Steph and Gian are great people.” Inan told news.com.au he was doing fine, adding the awkward situation was “all in a day’s work.”The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record)Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitMore CoverageBizarre Block auction reveals huge problemBlock winners answer burning questionKyle and Leslie, House 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.Leah and Ash, House 2: Reserve of $2.97 million not met, passed in at auction.Read related topics:MelbourneThe Block",0.099,0.84,0.061,-0.9816

Swift, Turner and Hadid have all dated the same man and that man is Joe Jonas, yet they have remained firm friends. The trio were seen out on the town together and were joined by a slew of celebrity pals, including model Cara Delevingne, actor Selena Gomez and NFL WAG Brittany Mahomes. Jonas, of course, was seen as an ‘it’ boy in the early 2000s thanks to the success of his band The Jonas Brothers. It was a period of skinny jeans, side fringes and starring in Disney’s Camp Rock, with the singer dating his fair share of famous women over the years.The girls were all hanging out. Picture: JosiahW / BACKGRIDThe friendship group seems like goals. JosiahW / BACKGRIDBoth Hadid and Swift dated him but Turner took it one step further and married Jonas, with the pair sharing daughters, Willa, 3, and Delphine, 1. This year, the couple announced they were divorcing and immediately called in the lawyers to argue about what country their two children would live in. Turner is from the United Kingdom and wanted to raise their two daughters there, but Jonas wanted them to stay in America. They’ve since reached an agreement. Taylor and Joe dated in 2008.

It is interesting because Swift famously dated Jonas in 2008 and later complained on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he broke up with her in a 27-second phone call. “When I find that person that is right for me, he’ll be wonderful! When I look at that person, I’m not even going to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 27 seconds when I was 18,” she famously said. In 2015, the pair were spotted hanging out together again, not because they’d gotten back together but because Jonas had started dating Swift’s good friend, Hadid.

Recently he released his top tips to “triple” your salary, telling people in their early 20s that they need to be in the office because they won’t be able to “build a network” when they are working from home and instead not “showing their face” in an office environment.After receiving backlash to the advice, Toby doubled down on his stance, saying the reason he believes young people need to be in the office more is because they’re “all miserable”, “don’t have any confidence” and “lack serious social skills”.Toby believes young people need to ‘show their face’ in the office in order to be successful. Picture: @techtoby/TikTokHe said Gen Zers were ‘lazy’ and ‘lacked social skills’.

For some years now, millionaire Danny Wallis has been the man to impress for contestants hoping to make a tidy profit on their homes. Wallis had tickled viewers and infuriated auctioneers during previous The Block auctions, with his love of making confusing, super-specific bids down to the cent.Danny Wallis: Fond of a confusing bid.Adrian Portelli: Will bid against himself if nobody else is interested.Last year, a new odd rich dude entered the fray: ‘Lambo Guy’ Adrian Portelli, who bought Omar and Oz’s house for a sky-high price to deliver them a then-record-breaking $1.68m profit.And last night, viewers watched as Portelli and Wallis were locked in a bidding battle across several properties. Wallis was up to his usual tricks, leaving the auctioneers struggling to keep up while he dropped head-scratching bids like “Three million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety hundred dollars … and ninety nine cents.” Portelli (left) and Wallis shake hands after another bizarre auction. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9But Portelli had some bizarre auction tactics of his own, bidding against himself not once but twice during sisters Eliza and Liberty’s auction. Both times, he raised the price by $100,000 – apparently, just because he could.“That’s … never happened before,” said a dumbfounded Scott Cam, while the auctioneer called it “the strangest auction I’ve ever done.”Those showboating antics meant huge financial windfalls for the contestants whose properties Portelli bought this year – three in total, for a combined spend of $12.4 million.Young Sydney couple Steph and Gian fared best, breaking all Block records with an astonishing $1.75m season win. Eliza and Liberty also became instant millionaires, making a profit of $1.05m, and Kyle and Leslie scored a respectable $130,000 profit when Portelli bought their house in a less hotly contested auction. All smiles: Portelli just made Steph and Gian millionaires. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9But the two couples who couldn’t spark the interest of either of these duelling multi-millionaires fared worse: Kristy and Brett’s property limped over reserve to give them meagre winnings of $65,000, while Leah and Ash pulled their house from auction as it crawled towards the reserve, scared of suffering a similar fate.Without interest from Portelli or Wallis, Kristy and Brett made just $65k. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9Which begs the question – are these the more indicative Block auction results? Take two incredibly rich men with a love of televised auction showboating out of the mix, and would everyone have walked away with next to nothing? Viewers expressed their frustrations on social media as the auctions unfolded:Someone just casually outbidding their own bid by $100,000 meanwhile the rest of us are struggling to buy groceries. The bids this season are making it hard to watch, itâ€™s not competitive just a splash of cash. Makes me sad but also feel a bit sick lol #theblock— S (@vlada_sasha) November 5, 2023Remember how we all complained about how there are always so many people at the auction but only a few bid....well now there is one guy bidding and he has to bid against himself just to make it even seem like an auction! #TheBlock— Colonel Kickhead (@colonelkickhead) November 5, 2023Can we get a season of the Block where they create much less expensive, beautiful homes normal people can bid on?

They sell at an amount the two multi-millionaires want to give the contestants. Tip. Be the nice guys next year! #TheBlock— bridgpa (@bvam14) November 5, 2023So let me get this right, a house is on the market with a bid at $4m (reserve $3.35m) with the room not filled with contested bidders and someone makes a $1m bid - unnecessarily - and buys the house for $5m. What am I missing?? #TheBlock— Peter Filopoulos (@peterfilopoulos) November 5, 2023Keen to give contestants the best shot at winning a life-changing amount of money, the show has leaned into the interest from these super-rich men in recent seasons. Wallis has even been offered up as a mid-season prize, with contestants competing for a chance to take him to dinner and quiz him about what he looks for in a home. And this season, couples tried to appeal to Portelli’s famed love of sports cars with luxury mod cons like a driveway vehicle turntable. This year’s Block winners Steph and Gian said they were “overwhelmed” by their massive win after the weekend’s auctions, telling 9Entertainment they had a “big” project planned with their $1.75 million winnings. More Coverage‘Heartbreak’ at wildly varied Block auctionsBrutal result for controversial Block couples“It’s going to clear our debts in Sydney, it’s going to really set us up for the next stage,” Gian told the publication.“There’s big things in the pipeline,” he added, with Steph quickly echoing: “Big things.”As for Portelli, as with last year’s purchase, he says he plans to use all three Block properties as fodder for his lucrative online lottery business, offering them up as prizes for punters who pay to enter his competition draws.

The colourful racing identity on Monday made surprising comments about the ‘Race that Stops the Nation’ as he prepares to watch his runners Cleveland and Serpentine in the $8 million handicap.

The 83-year-old, who is the most successful owner in Melbourne Cup history, will not attend the race this year. “It’s depressing. Corporate bookies have made it all very disappointing,” he told RSN Breakfast. Jockey Kerrin McEvoy celebrates his Melbourne Cup win on Almandin with owner Lloyd Williams.

She was able to do it under Jus Soli – also referred to as birthright citizenship.The list also includes countries in the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, a well as Lesotho in southern Africa, and Fiji in the Pacific.Her clip titled ‘Have a baby and get an extra passport’ has attracted almost half a million views and has been met with hundreds of divisive comments.Some have thanked the influencer for sharing details of birthright citizenship, adding they are considering to make a move to one of the abiding countries, while others have described it as being for “rich people”. “This is some privileged sh**,” one person wrote.“New Age colonialism,” said another, to which Shannen responded: “Absolutely not”.Jus Soli – Latin for law of soil – means citizenship of a country is based on being born there.Michaela said “more and more people are leaving the West and searching for a Plan B”.“With an additional passport, you always have an alternative place to go,” adding that getting a second citizenship was a “protection in case anyone tries to restrict your freedom of movement’”.“You can choose which tax systems you want to be part of and diversify your assets. Travel freedom is personal freedom and the more passports you collect the more opportunity you create for your family, including generations to come.”However, this comment didn’t go down too well with some of her almost half a million followers.It allows the child to gain an extra passport and also means parents of the child will gain permanent residency, ‘with a pathway to citizenship’.One person sparked a flurry of comments after saying Shannen’s clip is “essentially anchor baby instructions for rich people”.“Who the f*** do you think has a bunch of money to fly to a foreign country for weeks when heavily pregnant? Who has money to up and move their entire life?” one person asked.Another said: “You literally said the words ‘diversify your assets’ … you are 100 per cent pointing this video at a specific socio-economic class. You’re either lying or so stupid you don’t see it. Either way doesn’t bode well for your image.” One person defended the Aussie saying it was a very common thing. She said ‘With an additional passport, you always have an alternative place to go’.“I have plans to move to South America and keep working remotely from any country I wish. Travelling is not only a rich people thing,” they wrote. However, the original commenter fired back saying: “I didn’t say that birth tourism was a rich people thing. It’s been done for decades.”“I said that this was an instructional video for well-off digital nomads on how to drop an anchor baby. Encouraging Americans to gentrify countries like Mexico in the first place and drive up housing prices for the people that live there on a limited income isn’t the greatest advice to begin with.”But her post has been met with criticism – with accusing the 24-year-old of ‘new age colonialism’ and being ‘privileged’.Many commented on Shannen’s post saying the practise should be “illegal”.“It’s crazy that white people can advertise how to have anchor babies in our countries in Latin America, but the minute the Latinos try to come into white countries they get shot at the border,” one person wrote. “Yeah this is only seen as a positive if you’re rich and privileged babe.”Others said “if you’re rich it’s called Jus Soli and it’s looked at positively, if you’re poor it’s called an anchor baby and it’s looked down upon”.Another said “but when Hispanics do it it’s bad”. One person hit out at Shannen’s comment on tax and diversifying assets.“Sooo you’re goin (sic) to use a country’s tax dollars (that you’ve NEVER contributed to) to your personal (likely at least middle class wealth) benefit?” “Sounds pretty financially abusive to the people who live in that country,” said another. Shannen has actively responded to a lot of the comments, disagreeing that it is for “rich people”.More CoverageWe’re fuming over ‘child-free’ zonesTravel blogger’s ‘tone-deaf’ post backfires“I’d say the Venezualena giving birth in Costa Rica and Russians in Argentina would disagree,” she said in one comment.

Last week, news.com.au reported that Melbourne-based Legacy Hospitality Group Pty Ltd went into voluntary liquidation.It had debts of $1.725 million, the bulk of it tax debts, but also a further $172,000 was owed to 241 staff members from unpaid superannuation, according to a report filed with the corporate regulator and compiled by the appointed liquidators, Andrew Knight and Sebastian Hams of insolvency firm KordaMentha. There are government schemes in place for unpaid wages if a company goes under, but this does not yet extend to recovering unpaid super.The Legacy group is spearheaded by Benny Avramides, a well-known figure in Australia’s catering scene who has launched a number of hospitality venues across Melbourne including his flagship catering service Tommy Collins and other more casual bar and dining experiences such as Hamptons Bakery, Ladybird Cakes and the Rumour Has It cafe.All these businesses are “part of the broader Legacy group”, according to the liquidators, and continue to operate as normal. Although some staff worked across the group’s numerous brands, they were technically employed by Legacy Hospitality Group Pty Ltd which means all their superannuation sits with the now-defunct entity. “I’m so angry,” James*, an employee who has worked in several brands of the group for several years, told news.com.au. James believes he is owed up to $3000 from his superannuation entitlements which haven’t been paid since March. The six venues part of the Legacy group. All of these businesses are still operating and are unaffected by Legacy Hospitality Group Pty Ltd’s liquidation.According to the restaurant worker, staff received an email in July from the company’s CEO, Mr Avramides, outlining his plans to “streamline” the business with no mention of the upcoming liquidation.“An important change … will be taking place in our organisation,” the email, dated July 11, read. “We are streamlining our business operations and will be implementing measures to enhance operational efficiencies which includes streamlining intercompany transfers, requisitions, and employment opportunities.”James said he had to sign a new employment contract in July and around the same time their pay run changed from weekly to fortnightly, but he didn’t think too much of it. But then in mid-October, staff received an email from the liquidators informing them that the company that had previously employed them had gone bust. Do you know more or have a similar story? Get in touch | alex.turner-cohen@news.com.auThe email James received. Picture: SuppliedJames said many were “dumbfounded” to learn it was in liquidation. In yet another email to staff following the liquidation announcement, Mr Avramides said: “Please accept my apology for any stress this may have caused. “It’s a very structured and official process, and clearly presents as such, however please rest assured there will be no negative or financial impact on our staff or suppliers, including all employee entitlements (leave & super, which will all be paid in full) and any outstanding invoices.”But when the issue of superannuation payment came up, James claimed “no one can seem to answer me” or give a clear timeline of when he will get his money. “I could be earning on my super,” he lamented, adding that he had to “trust them” to do the right thing and pay his super, when there is no guarantee it will be paid now that the business is in liquidation. “When you’ve got a business which is struggling to pay its tax, what if the tax man comes tomorrow and takes that (money) in the bank account” which may also be used for employees’ superannuation, he added. “It’s this not knowing. This is the thing that’s disappointing me the most.”Mr Avramides previously told news.com.au “It’s a really tough time for our industry and we’re working through this with the team at KordaMentha to remain compliant and ensure our staff are looked after and paid their entitlements”.He did not respond to further requests for comment. Benny Avramides started the Legacy Group but one of the businesses has gone bust.Following news.com.au’s article last week revealing that the company had gone under, Mr Avramides sent another email to staff apologising profusely about the situation. “I want to begin by offering my sincere and unreserved apology to you all for bringing concern and stress to our Group, especially at a time when I’m sure it’s the last thing anybody needs,” he wrote last Thursday. “For those who may not be aware, I recently made the regrettable, and ultimately unavoidable decision, to enter the LHG brand into Voluntary Liquidation. “I engaged a firm called KordaMentha to help us navigate the process, establish debts, and help us resolve to pay those creditors as best and as quickly as possible.”Later on in the email, the hospo boss added: “Our venues and production kitchens continue to trade and it’s business as usual as we can continue to work together to deliver great hospitality as we’ve always done. “To everybody past and present, I want to again apologise. I take responsibility and can’t tell you how much this hurts to have to work through this, and I’m committed to making it right and will do everything in my power to do so and ensure the wellbeing of our team remains a top priority.”According to a circular sent to creditors in mid-October, Legacy Hospitality Group owes $1.725 million in total to 258 creditors.Of the company’s liabilities, the largest chunk is owed to the Australian Taxation Office, sitting at $1.58 million.Other government bodies are also owed money in the wake of the company’s collapse, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the State Revenue Office and the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme.They are all owed unknown amounts.More Coverage$1.7m collapse in major hospitality chain151 ‘distressed’ F45 gyms trying to sellThe 241 ex-staff owed superannuation have ranges of as little as $11 to as high as $4500.It’s estimated that Legacy Hospitality Group has around $99,000 worth of assets.alex.turner-cohen@news.com.auRead related topics:Melbourne",0.06,0.837,0.102,0.9924

Meanwhile, two F45 gyms in the Gold Coast with the same owner merged together, with the lease for one now listed on real estate websites.

The owner told news.com.au that the closure occurred 18 months ago when their lease was up for renewal and they decided not to renew it.“We were at the end of our lease and it made commercial sense,” they said. They said it was a good business decision which has netted them more than 350 members at the Nerang site and they claimed to be one of the largest functional gyms on the Gold Coast.

Corendon Airlines — a Turkey-based airline — has just introduced “Only Adult” areas.And many have welcomed the measures, suggesting they would happily spend more money to fly free from children on-board.But a furious debate has broken out on X, formerly Twitter, over new policies barring children from certain sections.This could be a thing of the past. Picture: iStock“So apparently airlines are considering making ‘child free zones’ on planes, and I can’t decide if this is a dystopian shift or not,” one person wrote. “But generally it’s really sad how little tolerance people have for children and babies – even acting like they shouldn’t be in public.”Social media responses included a person commenting: “I’ve noticed people seem more annoyed with kids in public than I’ve ever seen before.“Usually people see little kids and babies and smile or whatever but that’s seeming to slowly change. It’s weird and sad.”Corendon says the over-16s zones in the front section of their planes will have nine £85 “XL” seats, offering extra leg room, and 93 standard seats costing £38 ($70) apiece.It will apply on the firm’s A350 flights between Amsterdam in the Netherlands and the Caribbean island of Curacao.It’s only in place on IndiGo flights at the moment. Picture: iStockWalls and curtains will separate that area from other parts of the aircraft, the carrier said – as they promised “a shielded environment that contributes to a calm and relaxed flight”.Some have raised fears such an approach could be extended elsewhere.An X user posted: “I’ve literally seen apartments flat out say they don’t accept tenants with kids – it’s disgusting.”But the Corendon crackdown was welcomed by others, including a commenter who insisted: “I will not tolerate a screaming baby next to me on a four hour flight.”The comment prompted the response: “Children are people too.”’Child free’ zones has sparked a furious debate online. Picture: iStockBut another wrote: “It’s a great idea.”And an X user suggested: “When I was a teen, a lot of kids seemed pretty well-behaved.“But I see more and more young kids that are incredibly rambunctious and loud and the parents just sit there scrolling on their phones.”Yet someone else added: “I was on an eight-hour flight with a woman who had a baby on her lap and they were quiet the whole time.“Luckily I haven’t had any bad situations.”Totally agree with #childfreeflights I would gladly pay extra for a seperate section on the plane— Alaisdair (@alaisdair) October 4, 2016While Corendon is thought to be the first European airline introducing child-free zones, other international carriers have taken action to at least keep the noise down.AirAsia X has a Quiet Zone on long-haul flights reserved for passengers aged at least 12, while budget Singapore-based carrier Scoot has a policy it calls “ScootinSilence”.Indian airline IndiGo has introduced similar measures.Earlier this year a PhotoAid study suggested eight in 10 travellers wanted adult-only flights – with almost two-thirds willing to pay 10 to 30 per cent extra to dodge potential toddler tantrums.And arguments over children on planes have erupted in recent months, including one when a kid in a costume with flashing lights annoyed fellow travellers on a night flight.Rival arguments have been posed by opposing passengers, while a flight attendant told of wanting child-free flights.There were calls for a crackdown after a “demonic” kid was filmed apparently running riot on a flight between Germany and New York in the United States.Families have also been taken aback to be charged extra to fly with babies on their laps.More Coverage‘I’m allowed!’: Reclined seat sparks plane rowAmazing reason jets suddenly flying fasterBut another parent has shared her suggested hack to help make flying with children easier for everyone.And another 11 top tips have been offered to help keep kids happy when holidaying.

I’ve got my eye on 2022 Cup winner Gold Trip to go back-to-back and there are some alarming warning signs surrounding some of the horses considered to be the biggest challengers to the seven-year-old gelding.Gold Trip was also given another boost on Saturday after drawing Gate No. 2 during the barrier draw. Here’s everything you need to know about each runner for when the race that stops the nation jumps at 3pm (AEDT) on Tuesday at Flemington.The big news across the field on Tuesday morning was the decision from connections of Future notifying stewards of their intention to ride the horse forward. Tuesdays Weather Forecast – 29C, medium chance of showers for the afternoonExpected Track Conditions – Track will be a GOOD4 at the start of the day, showers may change that through the afternoon.Mitch’s Race Selections1- GOLD TRIP5- VAUBAN3- WITHOUT A FIGHT7- ABSURDEBOXED TRIFECTA / FIRST 4 – 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15I’m backing GOLD TRIP to be able to pull off back to back Melbourne Cup victories.I have really liked his lead up races coming into this year’s Cup and it has been a very similar lead up to last year. The way he has been finishing off his last few races suggest to me that rising out to the 3200m is ideal. If the showers do get to Flemington before the race, I will be even keener. Need to include VAUBAN who, on paper has the best staying credentials of any of the runners in the field. Whispers from track work at Flemington earlier in the week said he looked unbelievable, my slight concern though is how he will present in the mounting yard if he isn’t very comfortable pre-race, so treating him as a watch an act option. WITHOUT A FIGHT was an impressive winner of The Caulfield Cup and will likely appreciate a Good rated track more than what GOLD TRIP will. Mark Zahra having the choice of the two rides and choosing WITHOUT A FIGHT shouldn’t be taken lightly either. Feel like ABSURDE is the best of the runners at “roughie” odds given he has won some very good staying races back home in the UK and the good track is ideal for him.

His lead up preparation into this race has been very similar to last years, with good runs in The Caulfield Cup and The Cox Plate. He has a few things against him including having to carry the heaviest weight of the entire field and there are questions around how well he handles a dry track. But, he has the potential to be a star horse who may not be bothered by any of those concerns and if the expected showers hit Flemington before The Cup, his chances go well up. The manner in which he won last year, you know he will see out this race strongly. Australia’s leading jockey James McDonald taking the ride is also a bonus.(2) ALENQUER (France) Trainer: Michael Moroney / Jockey: Damien OliverAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 9Weight: 56.5kgCareer Record: 18:5-2-1Career Prize Money: $1,502,333Winning Distance Range: 1400m-2400mTAB Fixed Odds: $71A European import who won a Group 1 race in Ireland in 2022 and competed in what is commonly regarded as the worlds greatest staying race The Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in Paris before he was purchased to come over to Australia. Those European form lines are very strong, but he hasn’t managed to find his best form here in Australia. He has had 5 runs here in Australia and has had a best finishing position of 5th in The Might & Power. He will potentially be the sentimental selection of a lot of punters as he is to be ridden by Australian racing icon Damien Oliver in his last Melbourne Cup before he retires. If ALENQUER can recapture his European form, he would go close in this race, but we haven’t seen much to suggest he can find that form here.(3) WITHOUT A FIGHT (Ireland) Trainer: Anthony & Sam Freedman / Jockey: Mark ZahraAge/Sex: 7YO / GeldingBarrier: 16Weight: 56.5kgCareer Record: 22:10-3-4Career Prize Money: $4,411,620Winning Distance Range: 1800m-2800mTAB Fixed Odds: $7The winner of the 2023 Caulfield Cup two weeks ago. He is a quality staying horse and proved that in his big last start win. He contested this race last year finishing 13th when coming straight off the plane from Europe. He has stayed here ever since so has had time to adjust to Australian conditions now. His form suggests he will handle the warm conditions expected, and a key piece of information is the fact that jockey Mark Zahra, who rode last year’s winner GOLD TRIP, decided to ride WITHOUT A FIGHT instead for this year’s cup. A very good chance to complete the Caulfield & Melbourne Cups double.(4) BREAKUP (Japan) Trainer: Tatsuya Yoshioka / Jockey: Kohei MatsuyamaAge/Sex: 6YO / HorseBarrier: 18 Weight: 55kgCareer Record: 22:5-3-4Career Prize Money: $2,200,392Winning Distance Range: 2200m-2500mTAB Fixed Odds: $19The Japanese are well known to be the breeders of the best horses in the world and they bring one over for this years race. We saw BREAKUP compete in The Caulfield Cup where he did get caught up in the fast speed they ran early in the race and he tired to finish 8th. He clearly needed that run to get some extra fitness leading into this race. One of the big question marks around BREAKUP is if he can see out a strong 3200m race. If he does handle that trip, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him cross the line if the first few and a good price. Each-way player.

He is a 3x Group 1 winner in Europe and his credentials as a staying horse are probably the best in this field. He should have no problems running out the 3200m and his barrier draw will see him get a very economical run. He did some track work at Flemington earlier in the week that was the talk of the town behind the scenes due to how impressive he looked as well and how nicely he travelled when running. The wispers will have rocked the rest of the field. The team have had a long term plan to compete in this race so expect him to be in top shape. But we will be keeping an eye on him in the mounting yard, the warm conditions may be something he hasn’t experienced before and you don’t want to see him getting to hot and bothered before he has even stepped onto the track. If his manners are in check in the mounting yard, he does look like he may be very hard to beat.

He runs like he should have no issues at all seeing out the 3200m trip and ran a very good Caulfield Cup run when flashing home to run by a few and finish 7th. Outside of that, his lead up races have all been very good. He has been having problems in his last few starts though with being very slow to jump away from the barriers. He cannot afford to miss the kick in this race like he did in The Caulfield Cup, it will make his job extremely tough given he will jump from barrier 4 and could find himself crowded early and with not a lot of room. But if he jumps well and at least gets away on even terms everyone else and can settle closer, he is a big chance, but that’s the risk you take with him. Good play Each-way.(7) ABSURDE (France) Trainer: Willie Mullins / Jockey: Zac PurtonAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 8Weight: 53kgCareer Record: 15:4-6-2Career Prize Money: $704,905Winning Distance Range: 2000m-4000mTAB Fixed Odds: $21ABSURDE is the stable mate of race favourite VAUBAN, but he does also have strong credentials himself as a staying type horse. In August, ABSURDE won The Ebor at York (UK) over the 2816m, that race gives runners a golden ticket into the Melbourne Cup.

With his rating back down now, he gets to carry a more manageable weight and is clearly proven capable of running out this trip.

His last start effort to run 2nd in The Geelong Cup was an encouraging sign that he may be about to find his peak form. The stable is confident he will see out a strong 3200m trip and will be hitting the line strongly late.

Her record suggests she would prefer that the track was a bit wet so look for those showers to hopefully hit the track, but also don’t be surprised to see her run a strong race here as an each-way hope.(16) MAGICAL LAGOON (Ireland)Queensland jockeys Ben Thompson and Mark Du Plessis will ride in the 2023 Melbourne Cup.

The rise in class will test him though so his best hope will be if he can lead from start to stop.

He has had one Australian run where he ran an impressive 5th hitting the line very strongly late in The Geelong Cup. That suggested that he appreciate the rise to the 3200m trip now and he can take some good improvement out of that first Australian run. He has raced against both VAUBAN & ABSURDE this year and was well beaten by both so may need to improve a lot of lengths to catch those two at least.

The police added there were still details to be finalised from the chaos.AN ‘ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY’The carnage unfolded on Sunday night when the BMW X5 mounted the kerb and crashed into the Royal Daylesford Hotel beer garden just after 6pm. Five people were killed after a car ploughed through a beer garden in Daylesford on Sunday night.

He was breath tested at the scene and found to have no alcohol in his system. FAMILIES SHATTERED IN THE CRASHThe crash was described as an “absolute tragedy” by Chief Commissioner Shane Patton.“There were in essence two groups, two different family groups that were known to each other who were significantly involved and impacted by this,” he told reporters on Monday.Hundreds of patrons had flocked to the pub to celebrate the unofficial long weekend with the Melbourne Cup public holiday coming up on Tuesday. Police have been combing through the crash site as they investigate. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettMultiple businesses in the Albert St area told NCA NewsWire they didn’t believe any locals from the “tight-knit community” were among the dead.One business owner, who did not wish to be named, said she had heard a worker from the hotel had been injured.The car ploughed through an area that had been set up with “lots” of tables and chairs in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with customers from the Royal Hotel and other businesses using it. Mr Patton said he had been told by the area’s head of road policing that the scene was the “worst and most confronting that he had ever been to”. “The way those police officers conducted themselves was absolutely amazing, totally professional, but it comes as a cost as well,” he said. “They will take that scene with them for many, many years … some may never lose that scene. It may haunt them forever.”Jugs and drinks from the pub can still be seen at the scene. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettThe scene has been described as ‘complex’ by investigators. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said “the hearts of all Australians go out to everyone affected”. “We are all shocked by what happened in Daylesford and so deeply saddened – for those whose lives were so cruelly cut short, and for those who can never be the same again,” he said.CHIEF COP SLAMS CRASH RUMOURSMr Patton rejected reports that officers were delayed in reaching the scene or members of the public were left banging on the door of the police station trying to get help. “That’s totally incorrect,” he told reporters on Monday. “The station was staffed, two police officers heard the collision and as I understand ran to the scene. It’s a matter of a couple of 100m or so, and they were some of the first officers on the scene. “And they did exactly what they’re trained to do and we’re very proud.”Local police officers ran to the scene after hearing the crash Mr Patton said. Picture: ABCHOW THE CRASH UNFOLDEDThe white BMW was travelling southwest down the town’s busy Albert St when it mounted a gutter and drove through the beer garden, according to Superintendent John Fitzpatrick. “It’s a very complex scene,” he said.Police are exploring “every avenue” into why the crash took place, including that there was a medical episode involved. “I will say the driver is not a person who’s known to us through national security interests, he is not a person who has prior convictions other than some traffic offending as in speeding tickets,” Mr Patton said. Police are not yet sure if speeding was a factor in the crash, with Mr Patton saying it was an “open area of exploration”. Community members have left flowers at the scene in the wake of the tragedy. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brendan Beckett“The vehicle was travelling at some speed, whether that’s excessive or not needs to be determined through our reconstruction which is currently taking place.” Locals who witnessed the horrific Daylesford crash last night reported they were left to care for the victims until police arrived at the scene.A local reported the crash scene was “very confronting as the police didn’t arrive for 15 minutes so the public were helping the victims”.“Helicopters were flying until late in the evening taking victims to various hospitals. People’s lives are changed forever … can’t believe the carnage in Daylesford last night,” she said.Nearby residents from the small town shared their experiences in the aftermath of the accident, and posted that they “didn’t directly see it happen, but I heard it. (A) loud crash, and lots of screaming, it’s horrible to hear,” they said.A woman from a business next to the Royal Daylesford told NCA NewsWire that she and her staff saw some of the bodies on the pavement.“We’re all pretty shocked,” she said.“It’s pretty bad, I’ve never seen anything so traumatic in my life.”She said she had closed her business and would keep it closed on Monday.Another woman who watched the nightmare unfold described it as “horrifying”.“There were bodies everywhere, it was horrifying,” she said.“I watched the whole crash. The car went up into the sky. I thought it was just dust. It’s only now I know it was bodies.”A 66-year-old man driving the car has been receiving treatment at Ballarat Hospital. . Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenMORE PATIENTS IN HOSPITALAn 11-month-old baby was taken to Ballarat Base Hospital in a stable condition. Three adults were flown to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Sunday night, with a 35-year-old woman now in ICU in a serious condition, a 43-year-old woman now stable and a 38-year-old man also stable. COMMUNITY RESPONDS TO TRAGEDYMr Patton commended members of the community who responded immediately to the tragedy. “There were numerous people there, community members, visitors, many people in the proximity who selflessly came out and aided those who were dying, aided those who needed first aid, just disregarded their own safety,” he said. Tyre marks were still visible in the grass outside the hotel where the car left the road. Pieces of shrapnel, appearing to have come from the white BMW, were littered around the statue adjacent to the scene where locals placed floral tributes throughout the morning.Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu attended the scene to lay flowers on Monday morning. “Just knowing that that happened … it’s so sad for Daylesford,” Ms Acquarola said.“We were here five minutes after it … and we saw it and it was just horrible.”People have flocked to the crash site to pay their respects. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brendan BeckettInvestigations continue. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brendan BeckettMr Deriu said bystanders who were first on the scene were visibly “traumatised”.“They were beside themselves,” he said. Ms Acquarola said in the moments following the incident the area was flooded with police officers and bystanders rushing to help, while multiple white sheets had been laid over bodies on the road. “It was a beautiful night, it was warm, the sun was going down,” she said of the busy area.“And it was instantly just destroyed.”Several businesses adjacent to the scene made the decision to remain closed on Monday despite the increased presence of visitors in the popular tourist town over the Melbourne Cup weekend.Jesse Leith, who owns a cafe and bar nearby on Vincent St, described the scene as horrific. He heard commotion in the street immediately after the crash.The intersection around the crash site has remained taped off to the public. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettInvestigators at the scene. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brendan Beckett“There was yelling and an eruption of noise in the street,” he said.Mr Leith closed his business early following the crash and said many others had done the same. He said the mood was sombre among the business owners and workers still on the street.“We’ve been saying how no one remembers anything like this happening in Daylesford,” he said. “It’s a shock for a small town like this.”One shaken shop owner, who drove past the scene just five minutes after the BMW had crashed through the outdoor seating, said she was hoping to close early.More CoverageInside the sleepy town rocked by tragedy‘Incorrect’: Cop blasts pub tragedy rumourThe tragedy comes just three weeks after the death of a local man rocked the small town.On October 17 the man is believed to have tried to rob a muffin cafe just 100m from the site of Sunday’s crash.He suffered serious injuries and is believed to have died on the side of Bridport St where his body was discovered by an early morning walker.",0.114,0.825,0.062,-0.9991

Dave Hughes at The Block auction.The first auction was the biggest of the day, with Steph and Gian’s house racing out of the gates with an opening bid from Wallis some $650,000 over the reserve.Incredibly, Hughes, who was standing near Wallis and his “people,” claimed on-air today that the bid had been rather a large error on Wallis’ part.“He has meant to say $2,999,000 and he said $3,999,000 – that was a mistake from Danny. That mistake got the ball rolling,” he revealed on 2DayFM’s Hughesy, Ed & Erin this morning. Appearing as a guest on the program, Portelli confirmed that his rival had “stuffed up” his opening bid: “I saw him backtrack, realise what he’d done, and I thought I’d put the nail in the coffin.” From there, the auction took another dramatic turn when a young woman in the crowd collapsed and was taken away in an ambulance to receive medical attention.It was later revealed the woman was a registered bidder on Queensland couple Leah and Ash’s home – later on in the finale, with one of their interested buyers in hospital, the pair chose to pass in their home before it reached reserve. Hughes revealed he played a key role as the action unfolded. Last night’s auctions became a showdown between Portelli (left) and Wallis (right). Picture: Supplied/Channel 9“I actually caught the woman who collapsed – me and one other bloke, the bloke from consumer affairs. I was the one who stopped the auction,” he said. “I said, ‘We’ve got to stop the auction, this woman has collapsed.’”Portelli also revealed the tactic behind his bizarre choice to bid against himself during Eliza and Liberty’s auction, repeatedly raising the house price by $100,000 despite already having the highest bid.Hughesy bought Block contestants Josh Barker and Elyse Knowles’ house in 2017. Source: Channel NINE“It was a bit of a tactic to scare everyone off so we don’t get into a bidding war … it was more just a chance to have a bit of fun and showpony,” he admitted.He said he was “out to prove a point” with his major cash splash at this year’s auctions, after being “absolutely shredded by the public” after last year’s finale.Portelli’s arrival at last year’s auctions, where he bought Omar and Oz’s house for a massive $1.58 million over reserve, led to viewer speculation his purchase had been pre-organised to deliver that team a win. Portelli fiercely denied those claims, and later offered the house as a prize via his online lottery business.

Photo by Quinn Rooney/Getty Images.Racing Victoria said Alenquer “continued to show signs of soreness in the near fore foot as a result of the stone bruise which was reported (Sunday)”.“Alenquer will be re-examined by RV veterinarians Tuesday morning prior to final scratching time (7.30am) to determine its suitability to race,” they said.“A further update will be provided on all other Melbourne Cup runners Monday afternoon once the second pre-race veterinary inspections are completed.”Trainer Mike Moroney was still confident about the horse’s health on Sunday.“He seems fine. It’s minimal,” Moroney said.“It just depends on how long the bruise takes to come out. We have 48 hours, so we will just see how we go. It’s only a bruise.”“He is not without a chance. I’ve got a great trainer who knows how to win the Cup and seems to be finding form at the right time,” Oliver said of Alenquer.Moroner said it would be fantastic to be involved in Oliver’s last ever ride.“It’ll be great to be a part of his fairytale, wouldn’t it. Don’t mind being a part of that. He’s had 31 rides and I’ve had 24 runners so we’re both seasoned.”Alenquer’s injury has put Damien Oliver’s Melbourne Cup farewell in doubt. (Morgan Hancock/Racing Photos via Getty Images)Considered one of Australia’s greatest ever jockeys, Oliver has won the Melbourne Cup three times with Doriemus (1995), Media Puzzle (2002) and Fiorente (2013).The 52-year-old’s victory aboard Media Puzzle was the most famous of his career, as Oliver saluted the heavens as he passed the post in honour of his brother Jason, who died in a track fall.Oliver is in good form, having claimed two wins on Derby Day including steering Kalapour to victory in the Archer Stakes to secure a place in the Melbourne Cup.This year's Melbourne Cup was set to be Oliver’s 32nd and last run in the great race.Speaking to the Herald Sun earlier this year after announcing his retirement, Oliver was looking forward to having another crack at the Melbourne Cup.“It’s good to get one on my last dance, you might call it,” he said.Damien Oliver has won the Melbourne Cup three times.

This is a real photo, not photoshopped, not a panorama, not a Live Photo,” she captioned the image.“If you can’t see the problem, please keep looking and then you won’t be able to unsee it.”Tessa Coates' wedding dress photo has disturbed social media. Picture: InstagramShe said the “glitch in the Matrix” almost made her vomit in the street.In the image, Tessa’s hands are snapped in three different positions between the two mirrors and where she actually stands.Many social media users were perplexed by what was happening in the photo, with several torn between congratulating Tessa on her engagement and telling her to run.“This whole sequence of events is both absolutely terrifying and hilarious,” one social media user commented.Another said: “Only you can find the most epic way to announce your engagement – mystery and excitement – congratulations!”“Obsessed that this is the deranged way you accidentally announced the engagement,” another commented.“How is this possible?!?! Magic mirrors,” one shocked social media user asked.One added: “What in the Black Mirror is happening?”Tessa explained she had gone to the bridal shop on her own and sent some pictures to her sister, who pointed out the discrepancy between the three versions of herself.The member of sketch comedy group Massive Dad admitted she was stunned, falling to her hands and knees upon seeing the eerie picture and almost vomiting. Later, she checked whether it was a live photo or a burst and neither of these seemed to be the case.Tessa was determined to get to the bottom of the issue. Picture: Instagram“I am freaking out, so the first thing I did was go back to the shop and ask if they were in fact mirrors or cameras,” Tessa recounted.“My sister is a very rational person so she asked one of the tech people she works with. She told me eight men were looking at the photo and all freaking out.”Out of options, Tessa went to her local Apple Store in a desperate bid that a “Genius” would be able to help her figure out what had gone down.She waited two hours to speak to somebody, with an Apple employee named Roger admitting he’d never seen a case this bad but it does happen.He explained that phones are computers not cameras, and so even without the live photo setting turned on it does take a burst of images from left to right.Roger further explained that at the exact moment the camera went behind her back, Tessa must have raised her hands and so it made a completely different set of images on the other side.Tessa pointed out the line where the photos meet. Picture: InstagramTessa was grateful to finally have an answer. Picture: Instagram“It’s made like an AI decision and it stitched those two photos together,” Tessa recounted of the employee’s explanation.“And one very clever person on Twitter found the exact line on my back, it’s a tiny tiny bit that’s not completely in line and that’s where the photos are stitched together.”The comedian also shared a photo in her Instagram Stories circling the line where the two photos joined.More CoverageMan’s ‘unbelievable’ act at mate’s weddingSister slammed for major wedding faux pas“They also said that Google Pixel – this is not a Google Pixel phone, this is an iPhone – have brought out this new technology where you take multiple photos and it chooses the best photo for you, and iPhone are Beta testing this technology.”She added: “So if you look at the left side, that’s a complete image, if you look at the right side, that’s also a complete image.”Tessa ended her explanation to her social media followers by saying that Apple employee Roger admitted the end result was a “one in a million chance”.",0.039,0.896,0.064,0.9698

Picture: Supplied/Channel 9Midway through the auction, when things weren’t going to plan, Brett got in a frosty confrontation with Inan as they convened privately.“What the hell?” Brett said. “You mentioned high twos, we spoke about starting the bid at $3.2m? Mate, I can’t believe how that’s just gone.” Host Scott Cam even had a crack, telling Inan, “You probably set the scene by mentioning $2.9m at the start. That got in everyone’s head. We just don’t mention anything. We know what the others went for.”Further, Kristy and Brett were frustrated Inan appeared to annoy big spender Adrian Portelli by referring to his lucrative lottery business as a “raffle” during the auction, which the multi-millionaire later admitted turned him off making a bid.“We do spend a lot of time, money and effort educating people about the nature of our business and unfortunately people like that... There’s a big, legal fine line between a raffle and what we do, so when we do hear the word raffle, we sort of shun that,” Portelli told Hughesy, Ed & Erin Monday morning. “It sort of put a negative spin on it, [and] I did back away a tad because of that.” Kristy and Brett had the lowest earnings on this year’s season. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9The problems didn’t end there, with Kristy and Brett also fuming that Inan declared the house was on the market, which essentially gave away their reserve price.Speaking after the show, Inan claimed a Consumer Affairs representative was on his case during the auction, urging him to state when the house was on the market.“With Consumer Affairs [Victoria] in attendance it’s very hard not to answer truthfully,” he said to Domain after the auction. “You can sometimes say, ‘Look I’ll answer you when I’m ready.’ But the reality is, with Consumer Affairs there – and they’re knowing what the paperwork says – it’s very, very hard to do anything but tell the truth.“They actually followed me around during the break and said, ‘You’d better make sure you reiterate that it’s on the market – I don’t think everyone heard you’.”That aside, Inan claimed there was simply “no money left in the room” following the first two sales, which were both bought by Portelli.He said buyers “didn’t see the value” in Houses 1 [Kyle and Leslie], 2 [Leah and Ash] and 3 [Kristy and Brett].“When I spoke to some of the buyers that didn’t bid on our properties they said they didn’t see the value in our homes, full stop,” he said.“It had nothing to do with whether they were cheap or affordable on the day. They just didn’t like them.”‘They didn’t see the value.’ Inan argued the poor result wasn’t his fault.Following the finale, there was an outpouring of support for Inan on social media, with thousands of viewers taking to a post of Kristy and Brett on The Block’s official Instagram page to say they “felt sorry” for the agent.“Am I the only one who feels really sorry for this estate agent?” one person wrote. “He’s only human and he’s on TV. It’s easy to just slip up when you’re nervous. I think it is so wrong showing someone being grilled by 3 people while they stand there alone in front of a camera. Poor guy, at the end of the day if people actually wanted their property and wanted to support them they’d be buying it.”Another added, “The way they spoke to the real estate agent shows why they are so undeserving of money.”A third wrote, “Not the agents fault. Price is indicative of the attitude displayed throughout the season. No responsibility and no ownership from this couple. The first buyer spent $5mil and said Steph and Gian are great people.” Inan told news.com.au he was doing fine, adding the awkward situation was “all in a day’s work.”The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record)Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitMore CoverageBizarre Block auction reveals huge problemBlock winners answer burning questionKyle and Leslie, House 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.Leah and Ash, House 2: Reserve of $2.97 million not met, passed in at auction.Read related topics:MelbourneThe Block",0.099,0.84,0.061,-0.9816

She has an amazing gift with horses, they relax so well for her, and they respond to her.“Looking ahead to a two-mile (3200m) race they are important factors when selecting a jockey for a horse.Jamie Kah was the golden girl of Australian racing right from the start. Photos: Instagram and Scott Barbour via Getty Images.“It’s amazing what Jamie’s achieved during her career and we’re looking forward to Tuesday’s race. What she’s been through in the last 12 months is unbelievable, she’s a real athlete, she’s well prepared and she’s a great thinker, a great horse person.“I think we’ve got one of the world’s best riding on Tuesday.”If successful, Kah would become only the second female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup after Michelle Payne, who won on $101 chance Prince Of Penzance in 2015.But a win would make her achievement all the sweeter given Kah was fighting for her life only eight months ago after a shocking race fall, ironically at Flemington.Kah, who scored a confidence-building double at Flemington on Derby Day, said of riding in another Melbourne Cup: “I’m very excited to ride (More Felons) in the Cup.“It’s a very, very special race for Australia and I’m happy to be on him, I know he’ll run the trip, we just have to get him in a good spot.”Jamie Kah after winning Race 4 on Spacewalk at Derby Day on November 04, 2023. (Photo by Vince Caligiuri/Getty Images)Kah, who grew up in the Adelaide Hills but now lives on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, finished an unlucky third in the 2020 Melbourne Cup on Prince Of Arran.The nine-time Group 1 winner missed the 2021 Cup and ran seventh last year on Smokin’ Romans.“Riding in the Melbourne Cup is indescribable, how amazing it feels to be out there,” Kah said. “To win the Melbourne Cup would be amazing, you got to be in it to win it and I’m in with a good chance.”It has been the toughest year of champion jockey Kah’s career in the saddle after she sustained a serious brain injury after a shocking fall in March.It kept her on the sidelines for five months and she eventually returned to race riding in August.Kah has struggled to recapture her elite form since returning from injury but has found plenty of allies as she strives to get back to the pinnacle of racing.Kah knows she has a huge opportunity on Tuesday. (Photo by Daniel Pockett/Getty Images)Michelle Payne said: “I think she’s just going through the motions of whatever she’s getting, the rides she’s getting (and) doing her best.“Obviously it’s very hard coming back from an injury like that but I think that she’s not panicking and you can’t.“She’s not getting the calibre of horses that she was, but I think she’s still riding as good as ever.“If I had a horse good enough for her to ride I wouldn’t have any hesitations in putting her on. It’s a game where you need the luck to be going your way and I always say it’s like a big circle, it keeps coming back around.“People that have ability are going great now and then it’ll come around and she’ll be flying again. She’s done a remarkable job to come back from her injury like she did and she’ll get back there.”Kah’s form slump coincides with her facing a misconduct charge over her part in a “white powder” controversy, which will be heard over two days on November 13 and 14.In August, her barrister told the Victorian Racing Tribunal that Kah intended to plead not guilty.It is alleged Kah was filmed by a friend, registered stablehand Ruby McIntyre, appearing to arrange a white substance into three lines with an identification card during a gathering at her home on June 17-18.Kah’s parents, John and Karen, represented Australia as Winter Olympians in short-track speed skating.Devoted to horses growing up in South Australia, Kah started her equestrian career working for pocket money in racing stables before becoming an apprentice jockey at the age of 14.Itâ€™s genuinely so nice seeing Jamie Kah smiling and happy again.

And when that happened, I thought I’d let down so many people in the world and that just killed me. I was not in a good place for a while.”Waller said More Felons, a $34 chance in the Melbourne Cup, had “continued to do well while in quarantine”.“His run in the Geelong Cup (5th) appears to have brought him along nicely,” he said. “The horse made up good ground, sustained a long run which is a good quality looking ahead to Flemington.More CoverageMelbourne Cup favourites get huge boostTalented jockey lands dream Cup debut ride“I was certainly happy with his performance at Geelong.

That works out to be around $5400 per week for the 12 weeks they were on The Block. “We haven’t even covered half of our wages for being here,” a tearful Kristy said as the auction closed. Kristy and Brett made just $65,000.And fellow controversy magnets, Queenslanders Leah and Ash, suffered the fate every Block couple dreads: their house failed to attract a bid above their $2.97 million reserve and so was passed in. One of their registered bidders had fainted earlier in the day, and needed to leave in an ambulance to receive medical attention. There is some hope for them, though: their house could still sell for more than its reserve after auction. Two of the three houses that were passed in during last year’s auctions eventually sold for well over their reserve, scoring their teams respective profits of around $170,000 each.A profit is by no means guaranteed, though. When the third house passed in at last year’s auctions did eventually sell, it was for $180,000 less than its original reserve, leaving last year’s contestants Dylan and Jenny with no profit at all from their time on The Block.Their house didn’t sell, but there’s still hope for Leah and Ash.The show’s executive producer Julian Cress said it had been “heartbreaking” witnessing Kristy and Brett’s disappointing auction result.“I think Kristy and Brett are two of the best contestants we have had on the show and I feelterrible for them that they had to go through that, after just watching their neighbours make a million plus. For them to make $65,000 is pretty heartbreaking,” he said.Kristy and Brett were left fuming with their auctioneer after he apparently veered from their agreed plan, openin the bids at $2.9 million and then confirming the house was on the market just as it hit reserve. From there, bidding slowed down, and the couple were left wondering how they could only scrape past their reserve following two million-dollar-plus profits. “Australia got what they wanted,” an emotional Kristy said of their result, referring to the viewer backlash they’d copped throughout the season. The brutal auction results come after both couples sparked numerous feuds with their fellow contestants throughout the season. Kristy and Brett were vocal about their belief sisters Eliza and Liberty were getting special treatment by the show’s producers, dubbing them “industry plants” and complaining about them on camera while wearing Trump-style “Make The Block great again” hats on camera.They could use those hats right now.Kristy’s closest Block ally Leah confronted her on camera midway through the season, suggesting the negativity had gone too far – which caused a bitter rift between them that lasted until the end of the season. “This affected the rest of my experience on The Block. Some serious, deep issues went on. At the moment, most of the cast are trying to stay very positive and professional,” Leah told news.com.au midway through the season. She said there had been “absolutely no realigning” with Kristy and Brett after their rift began.

I just looked at him like, ‘What do you care?’”“He certainly didn’t come in my house and find me in bed naked with a sheet over,” Copley added.“I mean none of that happened.”Teri Copley and John Stamos dated in the ‘80s. Picture: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesPage Six has reached out to a rep for Stamos but did not immediately hear back.Giving background on the timeline of the entire situation, the actress and model, 62, said she dated Danza, 72, for “about a year and a half.”She then met the Full House star and they instantly “hit it off.” Eight months into their relationship, Stamos told her he loved her.“I’m a girl. I remember that very clearly because I was waiting and waiting for him to tell me that he loved me because I didn’t know if he did,” Copley claimed.A few months later, a phone call from Stamos’ mother, Loretta Phillips, completely changed her view on their relationship.“She called and she said, ‘Teri, I know that you love John, but don’t plan on marrying him because he has no intention of marrying you,’” she recalled. “I remember like it was yesterday.”Copley said she assumed Stamos told his mother that and thought she called to try and “protect” her.So, she went to the General Hospital star’s home and broke up with him.“It was my fault. I was young. I didn’t know how to communicate with him to tell him, you know, your mother told me you didn’t ever want to marry me,” she humbly recalled.“We never discussed marriage and I wasn’t, you know, secure enough [or] strong enough to say that to him. So I just left it like that. I left him like that.”That’s when Danza came into the picture.“Three or four days” later, Copley said she saw the Who’s the Boss? alum on the cover of a magazine.“I opened it and I read it and in there he said that Teri Copley was the only girl that he’d ever loved,” she remembered.Copley hit back in a lengthy video. Picture: SuppliedShe says she dated Danza for about 18 months.The Redeemed actress said she then called Danza, who came over — but not to a pool house as Stamos claimed in his memoir.Not long after, she said Stamos showed up at her door to call her out.Copley went on to claim in her video that after Stamos and Rebecca Romijn divorced in 2005, she finally admitted why she broke up with him.“I wanted to because I’d grown up a little bit and I wanted to tell him what happened,” she stated.“And he looked at me and he said, ‘I didn’t know that, Teri.’”“He said, ‘I would have married you. I was madly in love with you.’”Following the conversation, Copley said she and Stamos were able to form a friendship.The dad of one also spoke about his relationship with Romijn, whom he was married to from 1998 to 2005, in If You Would Have Told Me.In the memoir, he accused the X-Men actress of treating him like he wasn’t good enough for her and also of having an affair.“Betrayal starts as a sinking feeling in your stomach, grows into a suspicion that clouds your every thought, and by the time you find out the truth, it’s uniquely horrible at first but also expected, like you’ve been waiting for something bad to happen,” he penned.More CoverageStamos ‘nearly quit’ Hollywood over FriendsStamos ex ‘blindsided’ by memoir“There’s nothing more to say.”Following the book’s release, a source told Page Six that Romijn “doesn’t want to give John any more oxygen or attention and help him sell more books” by responding to his claims.This article originally appeared in Page Six and was reproduced with permission.",0.046,0.854,0.1,0.9908

For some years now, millionaire Danny Wallis has been the man to impress for contestants hoping to make a tidy profit on their homes. Wallis had tickled viewers and infuriated auctioneers during previous The Block auctions, with his love of making confusing, super-specific bids down to the cent.Danny Wallis: Fond of a confusing bid.Adrian Portelli: Will bid against himself if nobody else is interested.Last year, a new odd rich dude entered the fray: ‘Lambo Guy’ Adrian Portelli, who bought Omar and Oz’s house for a sky-high price to deliver them a then-record-breaking $1.68m profit.And last night, viewers watched as Portelli and Wallis were locked in a bidding battle across several properties. Wallis was up to his usual tricks, leaving the auctioneers struggling to keep up while he dropped head-scratching bids like “Three million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety hundred dollars … and ninety nine cents.” Portelli (left) and Wallis shake hands after another bizarre auction. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9But Portelli had some bizarre auction tactics of his own, bidding against himself not once but twice during sisters Eliza and Liberty’s auction. Both times, he raised the price by $100,000 – apparently, just because he could.“That’s … never happened before,” said a dumbfounded Scott Cam, while the auctioneer called it “the strangest auction I’ve ever done.”Those showboating antics meant huge financial windfalls for the contestants whose properties Portelli bought this year – three in total, for a combined spend of $12.4 million.Young Sydney couple Steph and Gian fared best, breaking all Block records with an astonishing $1.75m season win. Eliza and Liberty also became instant millionaires, making a profit of $1.05m, and Kyle and Leslie scored a respectable $130,000 profit when Portelli bought their house in a less hotly contested auction. All smiles: Portelli just made Steph and Gian millionaires. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9But the two couples who couldn’t spark the interest of either of these duelling multi-millionaires fared worse: Kristy and Brett’s property limped over reserve to give them meagre winnings of $65,000, while Leah and Ash pulled their house from auction as it crawled towards the reserve, scared of suffering a similar fate.Without interest from Portelli or Wallis, Kristy and Brett made just $65k. Picture: Supplied/Channel 9Which begs the question – are these the more indicative Block auction results? Take two incredibly rich men with a love of televised auction showboating out of the mix, and would everyone have walked away with next to nothing? Viewers expressed their frustrations on social media as the auctions unfolded:Someone just casually outbidding their own bid by $100,000 meanwhile the rest of us are struggling to buy groceries. The bids this season are making it hard to watch, itâ€™s not competitive just a splash of cash. Makes me sad but also feel a bit sick lol #theblock— S (@vlada_sasha) November 5, 2023Remember how we all complained about how there are always so many people at the auction but only a few bid....well now there is one guy bidding and he has to bid against himself just to make it even seem like an auction! #TheBlock— Colonel Kickhead (@colonelkickhead) November 5, 2023Can we get a season of the Block where they create much less expensive, beautiful homes normal people can bid on? Itâ€™s boring with the same 3 bidders every time.

No normal people bid like that. #TheBlock— Akeem (@Bruce79215079) November 5, 2023The houses donâ€™t sell for what they are worth - hence why no normal genuine buyer should ever bid for them. They sell at an amount the two multi-millionaires want to give the contestants. Tip. Be the nice guys next year! #TheBlock— bridgpa (@bvam14) November 5, 2023So let me get this right, a house is on the market with a bid at $4m (reserve $3.35m) with the room not filled with contested bidders and someone makes a $1m bid - unnecessarily - and buys the house for $5m. What am I missing?? #TheBlock— Peter Filopoulos (@peterfilopoulos) November 5, 2023Keen to give contestants the best shot at winning a life-changing amount of money, the show has leaned into the interest from these super-rich men in recent seasons. Wallis has even been offered up as a mid-season prize, with contestants competing for a chance to take him to dinner and quiz him about what he looks for in a home. And this season, couples tried to appeal to Portelli’s famed love of sports cars with luxury mod cons like a driveway vehicle turntable. This year’s Block winners Steph and Gian said they were “overwhelmed” by their massive win after the weekend’s auctions, telling 9Entertainment they had a “big” project planned with their $1.75 million winnings. More Coverage‘Heartbreak’ at wildly varied Block auctionsBrutal result for controversial Block couples“It’s going to clear our debts in Sydney, it’s going to really set us up for the next stage,” Gian told the publication.“There’s big things in the pipeline,” he added, with Steph quickly echoing: “Big things.”As for Portelli, as with last year’s purchase, he says he plans to use all three Block properties as fodder for his lucrative online lottery business, offering them up as prizes for punters who pay to enter his competition draws. With an estimated net worth of $350m, you’d have to assume the man feels this $12m auction day was another savvy business move. ",0.09,0.762,0.148,0.9979

And while some hot-to-trot spectators are busy applauding the fortunate belle for bagging a buff, brown-eyed babe, haters are saying he’s out of her league, the New York Post reports. “WTF is he doing with you?,” questioned a troll beneath a viral video shared by 25-year-old Brooklyn resident Nadya Okamoto, an lifestyle influencer and co-founder of lifestyle period brand August. In the post, which raked up a whopping five million TikTok views, Okamoto unabashedly celebrated her 31-year-old boyfriend Henry Stevenson’s good looks, sharing fetching clips of the hunk accompanied by trending audio of a fawning woman. Nadya Okamoto's post garnered thousands of comments from men and women who were stunned by Stevenson's good looks. Picture: Nadya Okamoto/Instagram“I’m convinced I’m dating the hottest man alive and nobody can tell me otherwise,” says the popular sound bite used by Okamoto. The voiceover track was originally created by TikTok user @Howdypartner.jpg. “Every single day I’m blown away by how f***ing hot this man is,” continues the audio. “And he’s into me?”Okamoto isn’t the only one who feels her flame is the fieriest smoke show to hit the streets — digital droolers think so, too. “Damn ma’am, congratulations. Yes. Yes to it all,” cheered an impressed commenter. “I’m a straight grown a – man, who’s married and I got to say he’s a good-looking guy!” admitted another.

Others begged Okamoto for her secret strategy on snapping up the heart-throb, cheekily pleading, “Drop the link for the dupe — I need,” and “Amazon link please?!? A dupe is also good!!” in the hopes of bagging Stevenson’s equally dashing doppelganger. Many hot-and-bothered wannabes even likened the stud to the leading lover in the film trilogy 50 Shades of Grey.“Low key giving Jamie Dornan. You go girl!,” praised a fan whose remarks were echoed by a separate rooter who wrote, “Real-life Christian Grey!!”Okamoto isn’t the first woman to reach social media celebrity for her sweetie’s showstopping sexiness.

Keyboard critics flooded Mccarvell’s comments with venom, saying her hubby was “too hot” to be with her. Unfortunately, both Okamoto and Stevenson received similarly shaded snipes from contrarian killjoys. “He’s cute and handsome — but not hot,” sneered a troll. “No, he’s definitely not hot,” another naysayer spat. “Wtf is he doing with unhot you?,” added a cruel cynic, who was backed by a grump who said, “He could have done soo much better.”However, supporters leapt to Okamato’s defence, reminding the Brooklynite that she’s just as enchanting as her appealing Prince Charming.

Because honestly, that’s what gave me the strength to do this.”She said Brand had appeared to be “intoxicated” on set, carried “a bottle of vodka” and “smelt of alcohol”.Brand was recently the subject of an extensive investigation by The Times and Dispatches, a program on Britain’s Channel 4, which accused him of engaging in sexual assaults, emotional abuse and even rape over a period spanning years.Brand denies any wrongdoing and maintains all his relationships were “consensual”.“Alone, I don’t think I would have felt able to (speak),” the woman said.“Hopefully, when other women see another woman putting what happened to her out there, they will find the strength inside themselves to speak out.”Brand addressing the allegations on his YouTube channel.The joint investigation covered allegations from four separate women.One alleges Brand raped her up against the wall of his home in Los Angeles. Another claims he had a relationship with her when she was 16, still a high school student, and he was in his thirties. She has accused him of engaging “in the behaviours of a groomer”.A third woman says she was assaulted by Brand in Los Angeles, telling him repeatedly to get off her, only to have him “flip” and become “angry”. And a fourth alleges the comedian was both physically and emotionally abusive towards her in the UK.",0.119,0.806,0.075,-0.9769

It was absolute carnage when the race was eventually able to re-start with Alex Albon making contact with Nico Hulkenberg at Turn 1. Watch every Practice, Qualifier & Race of The 2023 FIA Formula One World Championship Live and Ad-Break Free in racing on Kayo Sports. Join now and start streaming instantly >That contact pushed him into the other Haas of Kevin Magnussen.The second impact was far greater, sending both cars into the barrier and out of the race.Debris and multiple tyres were sent flying across the track and Ricciardo found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time with a rogue tyre bouncing across the track collecting his back wheel and rear wing.He was forced into the pits to repair the damage before the race re-started 30 minutes after the Magnussen crash. Aussie Oscar Piastri also took damage from the scattered debris and needed to pit. Daniel Ricciardo took contact from the bouncing tyre.Both were then given the awful news before the re-start that they would need to start from pit lane a lap behind the rest of the field.Ricciardo was absolutely seething about the verdict from FIA stewards and gave them a serve on his team radio after crossing the finish line. “I could rant and explain how f***ing s*** these rules are, but we all know it,” he said. “So sorry for you guys. You did a great job repairing the car.”He went on to say: “Just because I’m an arsehole, thanks FIA”. Ricciardo and Piastri never recovered from the blow and were left racing each other all alone, ultimately finishing the race 13th and 14th — the very last cars that were able to finish the race with six cars unable to make it to finish line. In another gut punch for Ricciardo and Piastri, the pair never got the yellow flag they needed to get back on the lead lap. Ricciardo finished more than 43 seconds behind the car in front of him. His teammate Yuki Tsunoda finished P9. At least the Australians were able to finish the race — unlike Albon, Leclerc, Magnussen, Valtteri Bottas, Zhou Guanyu and Mercedes’ George Russell. Leclerc was perhaps the most miserable of the lot. Leclerc, who had started second on the grid, crashed on the formation lap in what David Croft called a “disaster” for Ferrari, with it later revealed he had a hydraulics issue, Sky Sports reports. “Why am I so f***ing unlucky?” he repeatedly said over the team radio.Drama before the start! ðŸ¤¯Leclerc has gone into the barriers on the formation lap #F1#BrazilGPpic.twitter.com/4gnA2LFACH— Formula 1 (@F1) November 5, 2023Leclerc was not in the field after he lost control of his Ferrari on the formation-up lap before the initial start, which meant he was not allowed to rejoin even if his car could have been repaired.When the race resumed, it was Max Verstappen that got the best of Lando Norris on the re-start and then went on to cruise to another victory.Verstappen eased to a record-increasing 17th win of the season with victory in Sao Paulo ahead of Norris.There was a tense battle for the third spot on the podium with Fernando Alonso keeping Red Bull Sergio Perez at bay by just 0.053 seconds.Perez passed Alonso on Lap 70 but the former world champion took the place back on the final lap of the race as the pair made a thrilling dart to the line on the final straight. Lance Stroll finished fifth in the second Aston Martin ahead of Carlos Sainz of Ferrari.Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton finished eighth for Mercedes.For Verstappen, it was his 52nd career win, lifting him one clear of four-time champion Alain Prost on the list of all-time winners.“It was really good,” said Verstappen. “A well-executed race by the team, perfect pit-stops and well done I think. I had two good starts which was very important and then managed the tyres.” For Norris it was a seventh podium this year and 13th of his career, the most by any driver without recording a victory.“I couldn’t have done any better,” Norris said. “P2 is as good as it gets nowadays. So, I’m happy with that. Max always had an answer.” Alonso held off Perez after the two swapped places twice in the closing laps. “It was like 30 laps of pressure from Checo! When he passed me two laps from the end, I thought a podium was not possible and it was gone, but I got it back,” said the Spaniard.Brazilian Grand Prix result1) Max Verstappen, Red Bull2) Lando Norris, McLaren3) Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin4) Sergio Perez, Red Bull5) Lance Stroll, Aston Martin6) Carlos Sainz, Ferrari7) Pierre Gasly, Alpine8) Lewis Hamilton, MercedesMore CoverageFormula 1 stunned by wild 0.053sec robberyRicciardo loses his mind in fiery tirade9) Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri10) Esteban Ocon, Alpine— with AFPRead related topics:Daniel Ricciardo",0.056,0.84,0.104,0.9955

Emergency services were called to Royal Hotel in Daylesford, north of Melbourne, after a white BMW X5 crashed into the busy venue and struck patrons just after 6pm on Sunday, killing five people and injuring several others.During a press conference on Monday, Victoria Police chief commissioner Shane Patton rejected reports that officers were delayed in reaching the scene or that members of the public were left banging on the door of the police station trying to get help. “That‘s totally incorrect,” he told reporters on Monday. “The station was staffed, two police officers heard the collision and as I understand ran to the scene, it’s a matter of a couple of 100 meters or so, and they were some of the first officers on the scene. “And they did exactly what they’re trained to do and we’re very proud.”Victorian Police address the media in relation to the major fatal car crash in Daylesford, Victoria.

Droves of community members, some tearful, attended the site of the incident to lay flowers through Monday morning. Several businesses adjacent to the scene made the decision to remain closed on Monday, despite the increased presence of visitors in the popular tourist town over the Melbourne Cup weekend. Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu attended the scene to lay flowers on Monday morning. “Just knowing that that happened... it’s so sad for Daylesford,” Ms Acquarola said.“We were here five minutes after it... and we saw it and it was just horrible.” Mr Deriu said bystanders who were first on the scene were visibly “traumatised”.“They were beside themselves,” he said. Ms Acquarola said in the moments following the incident the area was flooded with police officers and bystanders rushing to help, while multiple white sheets had been laid over bodies on the road. “It was a beautiful night, it was warm, the sun was going down,” she said of the busy area.“And it was instantly just destroyed.” The intersection around the crash site has remained taped off to the public.A general view from the scene of the crash. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettSuperintendent John Fitzpatrick confirmed on Sunday night about 11pm four people had died at the scene – two men and a woman and a six-year-old boy.A fifth, a teenage girl, later died in hospital. “I haven’t seen anything this drastic for a long time,” he said.“Any time you have five people die at a particular scene, it’s horrible.“There are families that have got loved ones that are no longer going to be around.” “We don’t like to see anyone lose their life but to see a child – you don’t ever want to see anything like that.”“The car crashed into an area that has been set up really post-Covid with lots of tables and chairs, not just for the Royal Hotel, there’s an ice-cream shop there as well, so there (would have been) a lot of families. And it was a really warm night, and we’ve got a long weekend … so it was pretty busy last night,” she told ABC Radio on Monday morning. “People have lost their lives, and their families’ lives have changed forever. “It will really have shocked a lot of people, and I think we’re really only just be coming to terms with what happened today.”Superintendent John Fitzpatrick confirmed that five people, including two children, had died in the crash. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenSuperintendent Fitzpatrick said the white BMW was travelling southwest down Albert St in the town when it mounted a kerb and drove through the beer garden.He said the driver of the car, a 66-year-old Mt Macedon man, was receiving treatment at Ballarat Hospital.“We are waiting to speak to him,” he said. He said investigators were still trying to work out the cause of the tragedy.“It’s a very complex scene,” he said.Superintendent Fitzpatrick said investigators were also still working to identify if any of the victims were related to one another. Crash reconstruction investigators were on scene Sunday night trying to determine the speed of the car, Superintendent Fitzpatrick said. He said the police would canvass the area for CCTV footage.Five people are dead and multiple people suffered serious injuries in the horror incident. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenHe said emergency services personnel would be offered counselling to help them process the “confronting” scene. A woman from a business next to the Royal Daylesford told NCA NewsWire she and her staff saw some of the bodies on the pavement.“We’re all pretty shocked,” she said.“It’s pretty bad, I’ve never seen anything so traumatic in my life.”She said she had closed her business and would keep it closed on Monday.Another woman who watched the nightmare unfold described it as “horrifying”. “There were bodies everywhere, it was horrifying,” she said.“I watched the whole crash.

He heard commotion in the street immediately after the crash.“There was yelling and an eruption of noise in the street,” he said.Mr Leith closed his business early following the crash and said many others had done the same. He said the mood was sombre among the business owners and workers still on the street.Massive emergency resources were directed to the horror crash.

Hayes, 67, opens up about that tumultuous time in her life in a podcast interview to accompany her feature in the latest issue of Stellar magazine, out today. Hayes had married her first husband Brian, a builder in her hometown of Taree, in the late 70s when she was 21 years old. They split in the mid-80s, around the time she was appointed co-host of the Today show and her career and public profile skyrocketed.Then came a brief marriage in February 1991, to Australian entrepreneur John Singleton. They split by Christmas of that year, Hayes becoming the fourth of his six wives, and remained friends. With second husband John Singleton in 1991.With third husband, Dr Stephen Coogan.In 1994 came another marriage, to Sydney doctor Stephen Coogan – but they split in 1997. With three divorces under her belt at the age of 40, the journo who’d always cherished her privacy found herself becoming the story, with speculation about her rocky love life in tabloids and women’s weekly mags in the late 90s.“It was a crap time. Let’s face it, these things are not great. And it’s magnified. It becomes bigger than Ben Hur,” Hayes told Stellar. “You’re looking at yourself. You’re reading about yourself. You’re noting that the view of you is pretty grim, so you come away thinking, I am pretty grim, I’m a bit of a failure on that front – and people are writing that,” she said. She confessed it felt “soul destroying” to see the attention her string of failed marriages had garnered. Hayes described the attention around her failed marriages as “soul destroying.” Picture: Don Arnold“You could go knock on everybody’s door and say, ‘Well, can I give you a bit of backstory?’ You can’t do that, so you just have to accept that that’s the deal.

(And somewhere up above, Queen Mary suddenly feels faint.)Camilla has become the first Queen in British history to have started her Christmas shopping while on an official State Tour, going on such a spree at a craft market at a donkey sanctuary in Nairobi her aides ran out of cash and had to dash around issuing IOUs. And Meghan? This week her TV alma mater Suits broke all records and hit its 14th week as the most streamed TV show in the world. It has broken so much streaming ground they are probably running out of spades. And while I would very much like to spend the next thousand words of this story examining in minute detail just who might be getting what from Her Majesty’s donkey bender come December 24 (maybe the sisal bag she bought was for Prince Andrew to carry around all his lawyers’ bills?) it’s the Meghan milestone that demands a closer look. Because two things are happening right now and they don’t quite gel. Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane in Suits/ Picture: Ian Watson/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty ImagesOn one hand, Suits, the cable dramedy bought by Netflix earlier this year has, out of the blue, been attracting stratospheric viewing numbers. For example, in one week in August alone, it was watched for 3.9 billion minutes – that’s 65 million hours. Holy hell. The legal procedural is at least the second, and by now might be the first, most-streamed series ever recorded by Nielsen. (Based on numbers over consecutive weeks.) And yet on the other hand, Meghan and her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex seem stuck in the doldrumest of career doldrums.How come Suits is sailing past milestones and view counts like a TV steamroller yet the Sussexes’ stock remains decidedly lukewarm? When Suits first aired back in 2011, it did moderately well, with an average of 4.28 million people tuning in per episode. However, by the time season seven debuted, the final one to star a certain actress who was by then busy across the ocean having a tiara fitted, that number had fallen to 1.3 million. Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams in Suits. Picture: Shane Mahood/USA NetworkIn the Suits season five finale, Meghan Markle's character Rachel Zane in a wedding dress.Star Patrick J. Adams got a 2012 SAG Awards nomination but otherwise the series was entirely blanked by the more prestigious gong shows like the Emmys and the Golden Globes. Still, while the show had an undeniable and considerable fanbase, we are not talking about a series that reinvented the genre or set the entertainment world on fire. Then earlier this year Netflix, which also happens to have Harry & Meghan on their books, threw down some cash and bought the rights to stream Suits. KABOOM. (The show was previously, and still is, available on the US streaming channel Peacock). Soon after landing on the platform, the show started topping the weekly Nielsen chart of most streamed content, leaving much more recent or big budget shows in its pinstriped wake. If you had asked me back then what the consequences of Suits’ resurgence would be for Meghan, I would have called it a gift that would keep on giving (like Andrew’s sisal bag). I would have made the case that the duchess’s face suddenly appearing in millions of lounge rooms and showing her as the savvy, driven Rachel Zane would have seen a corresponding bounce in her popularity and professional prospects. I would have assumed we were looking at the sort of comeback scenario that would have had Netflix execs rubbing their hands with glee (and finding their duchess some new documentary projects, quick sticks) and royal courtiers stocking up on Dramamine. Ultimately, I would have made the case that for Meghan, after years of being best known for taking aim at the royal family, this year’s success of Suits would have served as something of a restart button. Here would be a chance for audiences to see the duchess in a whole new light (or reminded of an old light)! To give her a fresh injection of cultural currency and to reorient her celebrity!Except, nope. Sorry. No dice. This year’s success of Suits should have served as something of a restart button, but sorry, no dice. Picture: Shane Mahood/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty ImagesIf there was some way to include a graph here, a technical question I’ve never pondered before, what we would see is the Suits line tracking energetically skywards while Meghan’s popularity slipped. In the second quarter (April, May and June), 40 per cent of Americans polled by YouGov (and reported by Newsweek) liked the Duchess of Sussex and 23 per cent disliked, putting her on an overall position of +17. However, for the months of July, August and September, the very same time that the legal series was enchanting viewers with its heavy reliance on pencil skirts and office banter, Meghan’s popularity was going the other direction. During this time, Americans who had a positive view of her had fallen to 32 per cent while those with an unfavourable view remained nearly the same at 22 per cent, thus putting her on +10 overall. (Another YouGov/Newsweek twofer.)Camilla Christmas shopping at the markets in Nairobi, Kenya. Picture: Ben Stansall – Pool/Getty ImagesMeghan’s career remains as underwhelming as Camilla’s grandchildren will feel receiving their gifts on Christmas Day. Picture: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Project Healthy MindsIt’s only fair at this juncture to point out that this year’s Suits Netflix rocket ship has not, so far, particularly helped any of the other cast members or seen any of them enjoy any sort of career revivification. The ‘but’ here is that none of them married a prince and had a wedding watched by nearly two billion people. The incongruity that I find fascinating is that while, over the last few months, much of the world has fallen hook, line and clicker for Adams’ Mike Ross, including his romance with Meghan’s Zane, the Sussexes’ careers remain about as underwhelming as Camilla’s grandchildren will feel on Christmas Day when they discover they have gotten £5 WH Smith vouchers.

The 44-year-old and the 47-year-old Blink-182 drummer are yet to confirm the news.The couple, who wed in 2022, announced they were expecting their first child together at a Blink-182 concert in June.Kardashian held up a cardboard sign among the crowd reading “Travis I’m Pregnant”, in a nod to a scene from the music video of the band’s 1999 smash hit, All The Small Things.The pair later told the world they were expecting a boy at a sex reveal party that month. Earlier this week, Barker let slip the pair are due for a “Halloween baby”, who he referred to as ‘Rocky’.“There was a benefit in Hawaii that we [Blink-182] were gonna do, but it’s the week that Rocky’s due,” Barker said on the One Life One Chance podcast.Podcast host Toby Morse complimented the name, made famous by Sylvester Stallone’s legendary Rocky franchise, to which Barker responded: “He’s gonna come out of my wife’s vagina like doing front kicks and push-ups.”It’s unclear if ‘Rocky’ is just a placeholder name during Kardashian’s pregnancy.Kardashian earlier revealed she suffered a health scare after she was rushed to hospital in September.She later thanked the “incredible doctors for saving our baby’s life” in a post on Instagram.

This week Dr Zac Turner shares how to avoid going ‘troppo’ on a budget.QUESTION: Hi Dr Zac, I live in Darwin, and it’s the time of year when it gets so hot people turn troppo! I always try to stay hydrated by using hydration tablets but they are so expensive these days. Do you know any cheap alternatives I can use to keep myself sane? – Will, 25, Darwin ANSWER: For those readers who don’t know what Will is talking about – in Northern Australia there’s a term for when people turn crazy from the heat and humidity: going troppo. It’s a manifestation of a few symptoms like hysteria, stress and crankiness that comes from dehydration and tropical heat stress. It’s a real thing, and certainly one to avoid. Every summer those in Darwin fear ‘going troppo’ from the heat. Picture: iStockAthletes need to be especially careful to keep hydrated and their electrolytes balanced. Just like a car engine can explode if there’s not enough coolant, our muscles can literally melt – a condition called rhabdomyolysis. There certainly are cheaper alternatives to hydration tablets, but first let’s look into why humans need water to survive. Water is vital for many body functions. About half our blood is “blood plasma”, which is over 90 per cent water. Blood plasma is essential for carrying energy, nutrients and oxygen to the cells in the body that need it most. Water helps to remove waste products via the kidneys. It also helps to keep joints lubricated, the digestive system functioning, the body’s temperature controlled and skin plump and strong. There are also these things called principal electrolytes: sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate and chloride. These are minerals that conduct an electrical charge when mixed with water, hence the name electrolytes. They help regulate a variety of your body’s most essential functions including nerve signalling, pH balance, muscle contraction and hydration. Water is vital for many body functions. About half our blood is ‘blood plasma’, which is over 90 per cent water. Picture: iStockThe concentration of electrolytes in your blood and other bodily fluids is maintained within a very tight range. If your electrolyte levels become too high or too low, serious health complications can arise. You lose electrolytes through sweat and urine, which is why you need to replenish more when exercising or living in hotter climates like Darwin. Fluid requirements are related to metabolic needs and vary from person to person. The normal turnover of water in adults is approximately four per cent of total body weight per day. So, for example, if you weigh 70kg, you’ll lose about two-and-a-half to three litres of water a day (not including sweating). This means you will need to consume that amount of water from food and drinks to maintain your hydration. People tend to go overboard on the hydration tablets and spend hundreds of dollars on them every year. I actually believe they are just sugar tablets and are the same as drinking salty soft drinks. I would recommend opting for natural, cheaper alternatives. This is my cheap fix – I have a one-litre bottle full of water, and to that I add a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lime or lemon. I then drink that over the next few hours. Simple and effective! Here is a list of my other favourites: • Coconut water is naturally low in calories and sugar yet rich in electrolytes like potassium and magnesiumCoconut water is rich in potassium and antioxidants. Picture: iStock• Watermelon and other fruit juices contain several electrolytes but are typically low in sodium and high in sugar• Frozen fruit like pineapple or berries are a great cold snack that can replenish electrolytes • Smoothies allow you to obtain electrolytes from blended, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. They’re a great pre- or post-workout recovery beverageWatermelon contains several electrolytes.Frozen berries are a great cold snack to replenish electrolytes. Picture: iStockFor people who struggle to drink enough water, as with any good habit, I recommend doing the most important things in your day first. So, when you wake up in the morning have at least 500 mililitres of water (two big cups) before you go for that tea or coffee. If possible after this initial hit of hydration, for the next hour try to stick with tea or coffee without any additions. This includes milk and sugar as well as their alternatives. The morning should be spent getting rid of the toxins from the day and night before so you can start your day with all engines firing.

Yarbrough and her then partner, former cricket captain Michael Clarke, made national headlines in January when their emotionally-charged carpark stoush in the tourist town was recorded by a bystander and obtained by The Daily Telegraph.In the clip, Yarbrough could be heard accusing Clarke of “f**king” Edwards, who he dated between mid-2020 and late-2021, “on December 17”.At the time, Edwards – who is the co-founder of Australian activewear brand P.E Nation -distanced herself from the public spat, saying: “This is not my circus. Yet again, Michael in his true nature has not taken responsibility for his actions and I was blatantly lied to.”However, after attending the first event of the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival at Flemington on Saturday, both women ended up at the same after-party at the city’s Beverly Rooftop. News.com.au understands the pair “didn’t go near” each other at the party or even exchange pleasantries, with onlookers describing the public encounter as “awkward”. Pip Edwards attended the official Tequila Don Julio 1942 Derby Day after-party in Melbourne on Saturday. Picture: Supplied/Tequila Don Julio 1942Hosted by Tequila Don Julio 1942, the event saw some of the biggest star attendees from Derby Day head to the bar following a day of racing, to kick on the celebrations. Edwards was among the select few at the exclusive “invite only” party, opting to wear a black dress after ditching her unique trackside outfit inside the LANDMARK by Lexus marquee inside the Birdcage. Edwards wore a unique white outfit trackside earlier in the day.

She finished the bold look with a white cap. Come nightfall, Edwards had changed into a black mini dress which she accessorised with small structured sunnies. Meanwhile Yarbrough opted for a white suit that she paired with a bralet underneath. Jade Yarbrough was also at the event.

That works out to be around $5400 per week for the 12 weeks they were on The Block. “We haven’t even covered half of our wages for being here,” a tearful Kristy said as the auction closed. Kristy and Brett made just $65,000.And fellow controversy magnets, Queenslanders Leah and Ash, suffered the fate every Block couple dreads: their house failed to attract a bid above their $2.97 million reserve and so was passed in. One of their registered bidders had fainted earlier in the day, and needed to leave in an ambulance to receive medical attention. There is some hope for them, though: their house could still sell for more than its reserve after auction. Two of the three houses that were passed in during last year’s auctions eventually sold for well over their reserve, scoring their teams respective profits of around $170,000 each.A profit is by no means guaranteed, though. When the third house passed in at last year’s auctions did eventually sell, it was for $180,000 less than its original reserve, leaving last year’s contestants Dylan and Jenny with no profit at all from their time on The Block.Their house didn’t sell, but there’s still hope for Leah and Ash.The show’s executive producer Julian Cress said it had been “heartbreaking” witnessing Kristy and Brett’s disappointing auction result.“I think Kristy and Brett are two of the best contestants we have had on the show and I feelterrible for them that they had to go through that, after just watching their neighbours make a million plus. For them to make $65,000 is pretty heartbreaking,” he said.Kristy and Brett were left fuming with their auctioneer after he apparently veered from their agreed plan, openin the bids at $2.9 million and then confirming the house was on the market just as it hit reserve. From there, bidding slowed down, and the couple were left wondering how they could only scrape past their reserve following two million-dollar-plus profits. “Australia got what they wanted,” an emotional Kristy said of their result, referring to the viewer backlash they’d copped throughout the season. The brutal auction results come after both couples sparked numerous feuds with their fellow contestants throughout the season. Kristy and Brett were vocal about their belief sisters Eliza and Liberty were getting special treatment by the show’s producers, dubbing them “industry plants” and complaining about them on camera while wearing Trump-style “Make The Block great again” hats on camera.They could use those hats right now.Kristy’s closest Block ally Leah confronted her on camera midway through the season, suggesting the negativity had gone too far – which caused a bitter rift between them that lasted until the end of the season. “This affected the rest of my experience on The Block. Some serious, deep issues went on. At the moment, most of the cast are trying to stay very positive and professional,” Leah told news.com.au midway through the season. She said there had been “absolutely no realigning” with Kristy and Brett after their rift began. The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record) Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitKyle and Leslie, house 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.

It was another rollercoaster auction day for The Block in 2023, with two teams becoming instant millionaires – while another couple’s house failed to sell at all.NSW childhood sweethearts Steph and Gian emerged as this year’s winners, their house – a season-long judge’s favourite – purchased for a massive $5 million.With a reserve of $3.35 million, that gave the couple a record-breaking auction profit of $1.65 million, surpassing the $1.586 million last year’s winners Omar and Oz made over their reserve.Steph and Gian have reason to celebrate.Throw in $100,000 in prize money, and the young couple are walking away with $1.75 million dollars, the biggest winnings in Block history.Also instant millionaires: Melbourne sisters Eliza and Liberty, whose house sold for $4.3 million, giving them a profit of $1.05 million over their reserve.Eliza and Liberty came second, winning more than a million dollars.WA’s Kyle and Leslie placed third, with a more modest profit of $130,000, when their house sold for $3.1 million.All three of those houses were bought by the same man: Adrian Portelli, buyer of last year’s winning Block house, who has emerged as the successor to Danny Wallis as the multi-millionaire serial buyer contestants really need to court. Portelli started the auctions with a bang, defeating Wallis with a million-dollar bidding escalation that had his rival saying with a sigh: “He can have it.”In one particularly bizarre moment, Portelli bid against himself several times during Eliza and Liberty’s auction, repeatedly raising the price by $100,000 despite already having the highest bid.Full-time Block buyer, Adrian Portelli.“That’s...never happened before,” said a dumbfounded Scott Cam, while the auctioneer called it “the strangest auction I’ve ever done.”And as with last year, Portelli said he planned to raffle off his new haul of Block properties. “I think with the three houses I bought, there is only a small percentage of Aussies who can afford something of this value. To be able to buy them and potentially give someone else a chance to win it in my promotion means a lot.”Kristy and Brett had a pretty meagre result.The news was worse for this season’s two most controversial teams. South Australian couple Kristy and Brett’s house sold for $3.035 million, giving them a profit of just $65,000 for the season. And Queenslanders Leah and Ash suffered the fate every Block couple dreads: bids failed to climb above their $2.97 million reserve and so they decided to pass it in, lest the auctioneer keep pushing and only return them a tiny profit. There is some hope for them, though: their house could still sell for more than its reserve after auction. Two of the three houses that were passed in during last year’s auctions eventually sold for well over their reserve, scoring their teams respective profits of around $170,000 each.A bitter end for Leah and Ash.Speaking after their win, Steph and Gian said their were “overwhelmed” and described auction day as “surreal.” “This will change our lives,” they said of their $1.75 million win. “We have no idea what we are going to do with the money yet. It’s going to clear our debts in Sydney. It’s going to set us up for whatever the next stage is. It’s just unbelievable.”The Block’s longtime executive producer Julian Cress described Kristy and Brett’s paltry $65,000 auction profit as “heartbreaking.”“I think Kristy and Brett are two of the best contestants we have had on the show and I feel terrible for them that they had to go through that, after just watching their neighbours make a million plus. For them to make $65,000 is pretty heartbreaking,” he said. Kristy and Brett were fuming with their agent.“Australia got what they wanted,” an emotional Kristy said after the auction, referencing the viewer backlash she and Brett had copped throughout the season. For another year on The Block, it seems success or failure for contestants rests is dependant on the whims of a couple of very rich men - eccentric multi-millionaires so wealthy they can bid against themselves for show (this year’s mega-buyer Portelli has an estimated net worth of $350 million, so throwing away $100,000 in a pointless double-bid probably won’t keep him up at night).The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record) Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitKyle and Leslie, house 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.

Picture: iStockRent increases under a fixed-term agreementIf you have a fixed-term agreement, and it is for less than two years, your landlord can only increase the rent during the fixed-term period if the agreement stipulates what the increased amount will be, or how the increase will be calculated.Your landlord does not need to give written notice before the increase can take effect.It is not permitted for your agreement to say that the increase would be “in line with the market” or similar unclear statements.If your fixed-term agreement is for two years or more, then your rent can only be increased once in a 12-month period, and the landlord must provide you with at least 60 days’ written notice.You are entitled to negotiate or object to your rent increase if you think it’s too high. Picture: iStockRent increases under a periodic agreementA periodic agreement is one where the agreement does not specify a fixed term or the fixed term has ended but is continuing.On periodic tenancies, your rent can only be increased once in a 12-month period. Your landlord must also provide you at least 60 days’ written notice.Rent increases if there is no written agreementIf you do not have a written agreement, then your landlord cannot increase the rent during the first six months.If you disagree with a rent increaseYou are entitled to negotiate or object to your rent increase if you think the proposed rent increase is too high or not allowed under the law.Rent increases can only occur under certain conditions, depending on the type of lease agreement. Picture: iStockBefore the new rent amount starts, you can:• Negotiate with the landlordIf your landlord is permitted to increase the rent, but you do not agree with the increase, you should contact your landlord and try to negotiate for the rent to remain the same, or for a lesser increase. Your landlord does not have to agree, but if they do, you should request this confirmation in writing.• Provide notice to leaveIf you’re on a fixed-term lease of two years or more, then you can give 21 days’ written notice and vacate before the rent increase starts.• Apply to the tribunalYou can apply to the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal if you think the rent increase is excessive. You must apply within 30 days of receiving the notice.You will be required to prove that the increase is excessive, so you should provide the Tribunal with evidence of rents for comparable properties in the same area, the state of the repair of your property, and any amenities provided.The repairs you have requested seem quite reasonable. Picture: iStockRepairs and maintenance on the propertyIn relation to the repairs you have requested, there is a requirement that a rental property must always be fit to live in.A landlord certainly can’t agree to repairs being performed conditional upon a rent increase.The repairs you have requested seem quite reasonable. You aren’t asking the landlord to fully renovate the bathroom, just to perform some minor repairs.Even if you’re not able to reach an agreement with your landlord about them undertaking the repairs, do not stop paying rent – as tempting as that may be. Instead, you should try to negotiate a resolution together.If you’re still unable to resolve the issue, then you can contact NSW Fair Trading’s tenancy complaints and disputes service, or lodge an application with the Tribunal.More CoveragePopular Airbnb trick could lead to evictionUnbelievable share house act exposedFair Trading or the Tribunal may order a landlord to undertake repairs, and the Tribunal can order that your rent is paid to the Tribunal until the repairs are completed.For more information you can contact the Tenants Advice and Advocacy Service at tenants.org.au.This legal information is general in nature and should not be regarded as specific legal advice or relied upon.

82,126,757752979721347,"This year’s Block auctions are underway, and “Lambo man” Adrian Portelli has already broken his own spending record. WARNING: SPOILERS.",2023-11-05 04:11:50,331.0,267,5,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/lambo-man-does-it-again-who-is-the-blocks-big-buyer-adrian-portelli/news-story/70cbc2e8d7a2598cdb9015db3aefaa50?utm_campaign=EditorialSB&utm_source=News.com.au&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_content=SocialBakers,331,‘Lambo man’ does it again: Who is The Block’s big buyer Adrian Portelli?,"WARNING: Block spoilers below. This year’s Block finale started with a bang, with the first house to go under the hammer instantly earning one team the biggest auction profit in the show’s history.And as with last year, the man who provided the team with that auction day windfall is none other than “Lambo Guy”, flashy multi-millionaire Adrian Portelli.Portelli made headlines last year when he rocked up to contestants Omar and Oz’s auction and paid more than $1.58 million above their reserve, making them the runaway winners of the season.Portelli with host Scott Cam during this Block season.In scenes that aired on Sunday night’s finale, Portelli pulled a similar stunt with the first house to go to auction. Young NSW couple Steph and Gian have been favourites with the judges all season, and it seems Portelli was a fan too: he bought their house for a cool $5 million, miles above their $3.35 million reserve.He emerged victorious against fellow serial Block buyer Danny Wallis, in an auction also attended by comedian Dave Hughes, apparently a registered bidder with paddle in hand. It was a dramatic auction from the start, as just after the opening bids, a young woman in attendance fainted and needed medical attention. After she left in an ambulance, the bidding continued - with Portelli closing the deal with a jaw-dropping bid of $1 million over Wallis. “He can have it,” Wallis said, conceding defeat. With a profit of $1.65 million, Steph and Gian shattered all Block records, winning the season and scoring another $100,000 in prize money.And Portelli’s deep pockets continued with the night’s second auction, of sisters Eliza and Liberty’s house. He purchased their home for $4.3 million, giving them a massive profit of $1.05 million.And in bizarre scenes, Portelli bid against himself several times during Eliza and Liberty’s auction, repeatedly raising the price by $100,000 despite already having the highest bid. “That’s...never happened before,” said a dumbfounded Scott Cam, while the auctioneer called it “the strangest auction I’ve ever done.”Portelli then picked up his third house of the day, buying WA couple Kyle and Leslie’s home for $3.1 million, giving them a profit of $130,000 over their reserve. Three houses at a total cost of $12.4 million - not bad for a day’s shopping. How Portelli made his millionsPortelli on holiday in Europe.He spends millions on rare supercars.At just 34 years of age, Portelli is worth a reported $350m and is known for his eye-watering spending; last year he bought a rare supercar for $6.5m.A university dropout, he initially worked at his father’s truck repair business before striking riches in Los Angeles working in tech start ups. He teamed up with his tech-savvy flatmate while in the US to develop several successful apps, which they then sold at enormous profits. Nowadays, he keeps his coffers full by running various online raffles and promotions on his online platform LCMT+, where punters can pay for the chance to win big prizes. A chequered Block history Portelli made quite the entrance on the 2022 season of The Block, pulling up to Omar and Oz’s auction in his ostentatious yellow Lamborghini, buying the property for a sky-high price, than then promptly disappearing again. That led to some viewer speculation that he was only there to drive up the home’s price and deliver Omar and Oz the win, which all parties fiercely denied.Couple Kevin and Andrea Griffin weren’t happy with their prize of a $4m Block home. Picture: Jason EdwardsPortelli later gave the home away as a prize on his LCMT+ website – which recently caused more controversy when he was locked in a bitter public feud with the couple who ended up winning the $4.25m luxury home. Portelli said they were ungrateful winners, and had complained from the moment they were given their first tour of the house, while they accused him of removing $100,000 worth of items from the property before handing over the keys. After video of the couple’s complaints went viral, Portelli announced a $1 giveaway of all the items that were removed from the house, including a wine fridge and kitchen appliances.An extravagant spenderPortelli could not be accused of keeping his $350 million fortune under wraps, spending big on fast cars, properties and luxury holidays – all of which he documents for his 232,000-odd Instagram followers. Earlier this year he made headlines when he had his prized $3 million McLaren Senna GTR car craned to his penthouse on the 57th floor of a Melbourne apartment building: What exactly he’d do with the car once it was on the 57th floor is another matter. Picture: Jake NowakowskiWhatever you do, don’t reverse.The entire side of the building had to be deconstructed to make way for the car, which then took pride of place in his $39 million penthouse. Among his Block buys, he also reportedly bought a Gold Coast mansion for $2.3 million in August last year.The Block 2023 auction results:Steph and Gian, House 4: Reserve of $3.35 million, sold for $5.000 million = $1.65 million profit + $100,000 prize money = $1.75 million (a Block record) Eliza and Liberty, House 5: Reserve of $3.25 million, sold for $4.3 million = $1.05 million profitKyle and Leslie, house 1: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.1 million = $130,000 profitKristy and Brett, House 3: Reserve of $2.97 million, sold for $3.035 million = $65,000 profit.

FMG Stadium has a capacity of 25,000.It’s an embarrassing sight for an international final, and rugby league fans slammed Hamilton and the tournament schedulers.One fan wrote on X: “That crowd is abysmal. Where is everyone? And why would they choose to play the final in Hamilton, and not Auckland?”A second said: “The stadium is pretty much empty…..? WTF?”Another saiid: “Who’s decision was it to give Hamilton the Final? Terrible crowd, Rugby League shouldn’t be playing there again if they can’t even turn up to support their home country. Embarrassing!”The criticism was overwhelming, with another viewer posting: “This crowd is a joke.”Another added: “Great to see New Zealand supporting their team and an International final. Looks like there’s only a few 100 people there. Pathetic.”Not a good look for an international final.

Emergency services were called to Royal Hotel in Daylesford, north of Melbourne, after a white BMW X5 crashed into the busy venue and struck patrons just after 6pm on Sunday, killing five people and injuring several others.During a press conference on Monday, Victoria Police chief commissioner Shane Patton rejected reports that officers were delayed in reaching the scene or that members of the public were left banging on the door of the police station trying to get help. “That‘s totally incorrect,” he told reporters on Monday. “The station was staffed, two police officers heard the collision and as I understand ran to the scene, it’s a matter of a couple of 100 meters or so, and they were some of the first officers on the scene. “And they did exactly what they’re trained to do and we’re very proud.”Victorian Police address the media in relation to the major fatal car crash in Daylesford, Victoria.

Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenThe pub was filled with hundreds of patrons in the hours before the crash due to the unofficial long weekend before Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup public holiday.The area, which also includes an ice-cream shop, was set up post-Covid with lots of tables and chairs.Images taken at the scene on Monday show the chaos that remains, with damaged picnic tables still covered in glasses and water jugs. Droves of community members, some tearful, attended the site of the incident to lay flowers through Monday morning. Several businesses adjacent to the scene made the decision to remain closed on Monday, despite the increased presence of visitors in the popular tourist town over the Melbourne Cup weekend. Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu attended the scene to lay flowers on Monday morning. “Just knowing that that happened... it’s so sad for Daylesford,” Ms Acquarola said.“We were here five minutes after it... and we saw it and it was just horrible.” Mr Deriu said bystanders who were first on the scene were visibly “traumatised”.“They were beside themselves,” he said. Ms Acquarola said in the moments following the incident the area was flooded with police officers and bystanders rushing to help, while multiple white sheets had been laid over bodies on the road. “It was a beautiful night, it was warm, the sun was going down,” she said of the busy area.“And it was instantly just destroyed.” The intersection around the crash site has remained taped off to the public.A general view from the scene of the crash. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Brandan BeckettSuperintendent John Fitzpatrick confirmed on Sunday night about 11pm four people had died at the scene – two men and a woman and a six-year-old boy.A fifth, a teenage girl, later died in hospital. “I haven’t seen anything this drastic for a long time,” he said.“Any time you have five people die at a particular scene, it’s horrible.“There are families that have got loved ones that are no longer going to be around.” “We don’t like to see anyone lose their life but to see a child – you don’t ever want to see anything like that.”“The car crashed into an area that has been set up really post-Covid with lots of tables and chairs, not just for the Royal Hotel, there’s an ice-cream shop there as well, so there (would have been) a lot of families. And it was a really warm night, and we’ve got a long weekend … so it was pretty busy last night,” she told ABC Radio on Monday morning. “People have lost their lives, and their families’ lives have changed forever. “It will really have shocked a lot of people, and I think we’re really only just be coming to terms with what happened today.”Superintendent John Fitzpatrick confirmed that five people, including two children, had died in the crash. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenSuperintendent Fitzpatrick said the white BMW was travelling southwest down Albert St in the town when it mounted a kerb and drove through the beer garden.He said the driver of the car, a 66-year-old Mt Macedon man, was receiving treatment at Ballarat Hospital.“We are waiting to speak to him,” he said. He said investigators were still trying to work out the cause of the tragedy.“It’s a very complex scene,” he said.Superintendent Fitzpatrick said investigators were also still working to identify if any of the victims were related to one another. Crash reconstruction investigators were on scene Sunday night trying to determine the speed of the car, Superintendent Fitzpatrick said. He said the police would canvass the area for CCTV footage.Five people are dead and multiple people suffered serious injuries in the horror incident. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Josie HaydenHe said emergency services personnel would be offered counselling to help them process the “confronting” scene. A woman from a business next to the Royal Daylesford told NCA NewsWire she and her staff saw some of the bodies on the pavement.“We’re all pretty shocked,” she said.“It’s pretty bad, I’ve never seen anything so traumatic in my life.”She said she had closed her business and would keep it closed on Monday.Another woman who watched the nightmare unfold described it as “horrifying”. “There were bodies everywhere, it was horrifying,” she said.“I watched the whole crash. The car went up into the sky. I thought it was just dust. It’s only now I know it was bodies.” A police officer inspects a white BMX X5 close to the Royal Daylesford on Sunday evening.

The child, a three-year-old boy, was flown to the Royal Children’s Hospital in a serious condition.Two adults were flown to Royal Melbourne Hospital and one adult was flown to the Alfred Hospital, all with serious injuries. Air Ambulance Victoria sent four rescue helicopters to the scene to fly injured patients to hospitals.

He heard commotion in the street immediately after the crash.“There was yelling and an eruption of noise in the street,” he said.Mr Leith closed his business early following the crash and said many others had done the same. He said the mood was sombre among the business owners and workers still on the street.Massive emergency resources were directed to the horror crash.

Another witness to the horror said she saw people sitting at tables in the sun just before the tragedy.“They were having a wonderful time. It’s so sad to hear this,” she wrote online.Four Air Ambulance helicopters were deployed to the town fly critically injured people to hospital.“Emergency services are currently at the scene of a serious crash in Vincent St, Daylesford,” Victoria Police said.A car has crashed into Royal Hotel Beer Garden, Daylesford, killing multiple people.

A worker at a nearby restaurant said the car involved was “messed up”.“There are a lot of people outside,” she said.Daylesford is a small town about 100km north west of Melbourne. Infrastructure Minister Catherine King, whose Ballarat electorate takes in Daylesford, has sent her condolences to those caught up in the tragedy.“My thoughts are with all those at the scene, their friends and families and the broader Daylesford community,” she posted to X on Sunday evening. “Please follow all the advice from emergency services as crews undertake their work.”Hepburn Shire Mayor Brian Hood said the hotel was typically busy with patrons, particularly on a long weekend.“I can only imagine there would be a lot of people sitting out there. There are a lot of tables and chairs,” he said.A white BMW ploughed into patrons at the Royal Daylesford beer garden on Sunday evening. Several witnesses saw the horror unfold.

Friends co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc were among those who bid farewell to the 54-year-old at a private funeral in Los Angeles.As the funeral ended, Peter Gabriel’s song ‘Don’t Give Up’ was played aloud for mourners, with a source telling the Daily Mail there was “not a dry eye” left in the room by the time the song ended. The song includes the lyrics: “No fight left or so it seems, I am a man whose dreams have all deserted, I’ve changed my face, I’ve changed my name, But no one wants you when you lose”. Perry’s Friends co-stars were among those who attended the actor’s funeral on Friday. Picture: Mile Nelson/AFPPerry, who has been open about his struggles with addiction, had previously praised the song during a 2022 interview about his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. “It’s just beautiful. I don’t know if you’ve heard it as this was a long time ago but it’s beautiful and it’s saying don’t give up. I mean come, how am I not gonna like that?” he told interviewer Tom Power.Perry added that he would write the words ‘don’t give up’ when signing his memoir. “I always put ‘don’t give up’ because you shouldn’t give up.” The actor was found dead from an apparent drowning at his home in Los Angeles on October 28. Law enforcement sources told TMZ at the time that first responders were called to the scene following a report of an individual going into cardiac arrest.The 911 call was reportedly placed by his assistant, who found him unresponsive in his hot tub.Preliminary toxicology reports have reportedly also shown Perry did not have fentanyl or meth in his body at the time of his death. However, the full autopsy report results have been delayed pending additional testing.Perry previously spoke about the song during an interview last year.

Also in attendance – with a paddle in hand, suggesting he was a registered bidder – was comedian Dave Hughes. Hughesy famously bought one of the houses from The Block’s 2017 season, and this week revealed that after much speculation he’d overpaid for the property, he’d recently had it valued at almost $2m more than he paid. Other spoiler-free snippets from auction day shared in the group suggest this year we may not be in for the doom and gloom of last year’s finale when one couple only made $20,000, and another two failed to sell their properties at auction: There were reports of cheers heard at multiple auctions yesterday.

The confusion was largely in part to one glaringly obvious omission in Kristy Hawk’s menu pick, Kidspot reports: she doesn’t get a bun with her burger. As someone who practices the keto diet, Ms Hawk’s burger looks drastically different to your regular carb-laden Quarter Pounder. For more stories like this, visit kidspot.com.auThanks to a few cheeky changes and substitutions, instead she creates a filling meal that satisfies her fast-food cravings, without compromising her strict diet. “I don’t get McDonald’s often but when I do, I order this to keep it low carb,” she explained. Ms Hawk added that she likes to order it on the kiosk inside – rather than at the counter – as “it’s just easier that way and they seem to get it right every time when I do”. The order in question is as follows: a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese, regular mayo, light lettuce and pickles – but without mustard, onions or ketchup. She then shared a photo of her “naked” burger, where all the fillings are seen piled high on a bed of shredded lettuce. A popular low-carb food influencer has taken to her Facebook page to share exactly how she orders McDonald’s – but her 'irritating' order has left the internet divided.

After spotting a gap in the market, she began making and selling an eyelash serum, Long Lashes, in 2017, both direct to consumers through her own website, and wholesale, via other beauty websites and salons. But after noticing a sharp drop in sales recently, she received a call two months ago that has turned her small business dream into a nightmare. CanGro founder Felecia Tappenden is fighting back against the copyright claim. Picture: Supplied.The call was from a wholesale client, whose website had been taken down by its eCommerce hosting platform because it sold CanGro’s Long Lashes product. Ms Tappenden was then contacted by a number of other stockists, who had suffered the same fate at the hands of giant eCommerce website hosting platform, Canada-based Shopify.Investigations revealed the root of the problem – Shopify had been issued with a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice by ForChics, a US competitor claiming Ms Tappenden’s product was a copy of its own.Have a similar story? | Contact michelle.bowes@news.com.auCanGro's Long Lashes product is at the centre of the dispute.The ForChics eyelash serum CanGro is accused of copying.In order to get their websites reinstated, her wholesalers had to drop the Long Lashes product, a move she told news.com.au has cost her 80 per cent of her wholesale sales, which account for around 70 per cent of CanGro’s total sales.She said the 56 per cent loss in sales overall amounts to “hundreds of thousands of dollars”.But Ms Tappenden told news.com.au that the copyright allegation is baseless. “Contrary to their claims, our Australian made product, Long Lashes Eyelash Enhancer, is not a replica nor an infringement of ForChics’ lash serum.”She added that her product was released before the ForChics product, and she registered an international trademark for CanGro in 2016 which, she said, “cost a fortune”.eCommerce website hosting giant Shopify requested merchants selling CanGro’s Long Lashes remove the product.Ms Tappenden said that in order to have her products blocked from sale, all her rival had to do was send a DMCA take-down notice with links to both products to website host Shopify, without providing any evidence as to its claim.“Anybody can do this to anyone,” she added.Despite subsequently supplying documented evidence to Shopify that her lash product predates ForChics’ similar product, the take-down notice has remained in place, with the global giant advising her to seek legal advice in an email. The email she received from Shopify read: “Once we receive a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Takedown Notice, we must follow procedures and pass it along to our Merchant. As we are unable to provide you with legal advice, we suggest seeking independent legal counsel for any further assistance or guidance you may require.”The email Ms Tappenden received from Shopify. Picture: Supplied.Ms Tappenden said she has engaged local lawyers, Austrade and the Small Business Ombudsman to look into the matter, but unfortunately they have had no response from either ForChics or Shopify. Her next step is to hire a US intellectual property lawyer, something she told news.com.au she can’t afford and her mental health “wouldn’t cope with”.“In this case my trademark has been of no use but I know if it went to court I’d win,” she said. She said that while she is “confident ForChics are gone, they won’t issue another DMCA notice”, unless sales improve she fears the situation “could close my business”.“I just want my wholesale clients back. I have millions of dollars worth of stock with expiry dates sitting in two storage units”, she said.CanGro sells direct through its website and via other beauty websites.More CoverageGame company files DMCA request against podcast‘It works!’ New lash serum sparks frenzyMs Tappenden said that despite launching one of the first eyelash serums on the market, she never considered taking action against other similar products that have subsequently been launched.“There’s plenty of business for everyone,” she said.

In the ocean, a stone’s throw from Sal Salis’s alfresco lounge deck, the humpbacks are at play. Spumes of vapour billow from the sea, tail flukes rise and fins slap. Some whales even leap clear of the water.I’d wondered about the virtues of spending circa $2000 a night per couple (all-inclusive) to stay at Sal Salis, Ningaloo’s pin-up property on Western Australia’s central coast.

What she’s been through in the last 12 months is unbelievable, she’s a real athlete, she’s well prepared and she’s a great thinker, a great horse person.“I think we’ve got one of the world’s best riding on Tuesday.”If successful, Kah would become only the second female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup after Michelle Payne, who won on $101 chance Prince Of Penzance in 2015.But a win would make her achievement all the sweeter given Kah was fighting for her life only eight months ago after a shocking race fall, ironically at Flemington.Kah, who scored a confidence-building double at Flemington on Derby Day, said of riding in another Melbourne Cup: “I’m very excited to ride (More Felons) in the Cup.“It’s a very, very special race for Australia and I’m happy to be on him, I know he’ll run the trip, we just have to get him in a good spot.”Jamie Kah after winning Race 4 on Spacewalk at Derby Day on November 04, 2023.

(Photo by Daniel Pockett/Getty Images)Michelle Payne said: “I think she’s just going through the motions of whatever she’s getting, the rides she’s getting (and) doing her best.“Obviously it’s very hard coming back from an injury like that but I think that she’s not panicking and you can’t.“She’s not getting the calibre of horses that she was, but I think she’s still riding as good as ever.“If I had a horse good enough for her to ride I wouldn’t have any hesitations in putting her on. It’s a game where you need the luck to be going your way and I always say it’s like a big circle, it keeps coming back around.“People that have ability are going great now and then it’ll come around and she’ll be flying again. She’s done a remarkable job to come back from her injury like she did and she’ll get back there.”Kah’s form slump coincides with her facing a misconduct charge over her part in a “white powder” controversy, which will be heard over two days on November 13 and 14.In August, her barrister told the Victorian Racing Tribunal that Kah intended to plead not guilty.It is alleged Kah was filmed by a friend, registered stablehand Ruby McIntyre, appearing to arrange a white substance into three lines with an identification card during a gathering at her home on June 17-18.Kah’s parents, John and Karen, represented Australia as Winter Olympians in short-track speed skating.Devoted to horses growing up in South Australia, Kah started her equestrian career working for pocket money in racing stables before becoming an apprentice jockey at the age of 14.Itâ€™s genuinely so nice seeing Jamie Kah smiling and happy again.

She rode her first winner, Magic Tigress, at Clare on April 7, 2012.She has now ridden more than 1200 winners with career prizemoney of more than $71 million, of which she has received a 5 per cent share.In 2021, Kah became the first person - male or female - to win 100 metropolitan races in a season in Victoria.However, in the same year she hit the headlines for the wrong reasons when, in the middle of an intense Victorian lockdown, Kah was found to have hosted a rogue gathering at an Airbnb rental, breaching the state’s strict Covid rules.Kah was suspended from riding for three months, which Kah said “was the worst time of my life, easily”.“I’ve worked so hard to make this image of myself,” she said in an interview in September last year.Jamie Kah takes the win on Cause of Concern on Saturday.

Since welcoming her first child with Brunelli, son Lucius, in February, however, Kalifatidis said on Wednesday she now worried about sharing things her audience might misconstrue. “[Michael] said, ‘You never post organic raw stuff, your real life. Everything is so curated and you don’t post the way you used to’,” she said in a video. The observation, Kalifatidis admitted, “struck a chord” with her because it was “true”. Kalifatidis shared the 'sad' reason she’s stepped back from sharing more 'organic' life updates on social media.

I feel like it is. [But] it’s just what I think.” ‘All I want to talk about is my baby. Does anyone care? Probably not as many people as I think.’ Picture: InstagramKalifatidis pointed out that she “would never say that about my friends” who are also parents. “And yet I say that about myself.

I’ve got my eye on 2022 Cup winner Gold Trip to go back-to-back and there are some alarming warning signs surrounding some of the horses considered to be the biggest challengers to the seven-year-old gelding.Gold Trip was also given another boost on Saturday after drawing Gate No. 2 during the barrier draw. Here’s everything you need to know about each runner for when the race that stops the nation jumps at 3pm (AEDT) on Tuesday at Flemington.The big news across the field on Tuesday morning was the decision from connections of Future notifying stewards of their intention to ride the horse forward. Tuesdays Weather Forecast – 29C, medium chance of showers for the afternoonExpected Track Conditions – Track will be a GOOD4 at the start of the day, showers may change that through the afternoon.Mitch’s Race Selections1- GOLD TRIP5- VAUBAN3- WITHOUT A FIGHT7- ABSURDEBOXED TRIFECTA / FIRST 4 – 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15I’m backing GOLD TRIP to be able to pull off back to back Melbourne Cup victories.I have really liked his lead up races coming into this year’s Cup and it has been a very similar lead up to last year. The way he has been finishing off his last few races suggest to me that rising out to the 3200m is ideal. If the showers do get to Flemington before the race, I will be even keener. Need to include VAUBAN who, on paper has the best staying credentials of any of the runners in the field. Whispers from track work at Flemington earlier in the week said he looked unbelievable, my slight concern though is how he will present in the mounting yard if he isn’t very comfortable pre-race, so treating him as a watch an act option. WITHOUT A FIGHT was an impressive winner of The Caulfield Cup and will likely appreciate a Good rated track more than what GOLD TRIP will. Mark Zahra having the choice of the two rides and choosing WITHOUT A FIGHT shouldn’t be taken lightly either. Feel like ABSURDE is the best of the runners at “roughie” odds given he has won some very good staying races back home in the UK and the good track is ideal for him. (1) GOLD TRIP (France) Mark Zahra has jumped ship after winning the Cup on Gold Trip last year.

His lead up preparation into this race has been very similar to last years, with good runs in The Caulfield Cup and The Cox Plate. He has a few things against him including having to carry the heaviest weight of the entire field and there are questions around how well he handles a dry track. But, he has the potential to be a star horse who may not be bothered by any of those concerns and if the expected showers hit Flemington before The Cup, his chances go well up. The manner in which he won last year, you know he will see out this race strongly. Australia’s leading jockey James McDonald taking the ride is also a bonus.(2) ALENQUER (France) Trainer: Michael Moroney / Jockey: Damien OliverAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 9Weight: 56.5kgCareer Record: 18:5-2-1Career Prize Money: $1,502,333Winning Distance Range: 1400m-2400mTAB Fixed Odds: $71A European import who won a Group 1 race in Ireland in 2022 and competed in what is commonly regarded as the worlds greatest staying race The Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in Paris before he was purchased to come over to Australia. Those European form lines are very strong, but he hasn’t managed to find his best form here in Australia. He has had 5 runs here in Australia and has had a best finishing position of 5th in The Might & Power. He will potentially be the sentimental selection of a lot of punters as he is to be ridden by Australian racing icon Damien Oliver in his last Melbourne Cup before he retires. If ALENQUER can recapture his European form, he would go close in this race, but we haven’t seen much to suggest he can find that form here.(3) WITHOUT A FIGHT (Ireland) Trainer: Anthony & Sam Freedman / Jockey: Mark ZahraAge/Sex: 7YO / GeldingBarrier: 16Weight: 56.5kgCareer Record: 22:10-3-4Career Prize Money: $4,411,620Winning Distance Range: 1800m-2800mTAB Fixed Odds: $7The winner of the 2023 Caulfield Cup two weeks ago. He is a quality staying horse and proved that in his big last start win. He contested this race last year finishing 13th when coming straight off the plane from Europe. He has stayed here ever since so has had time to adjust to Australian conditions now. His form suggests he will handle the warm conditions expected, and a key piece of information is the fact that jockey Mark Zahra, who rode last year’s winner GOLD TRIP, decided to ride WITHOUT A FIGHT instead for this year’s cup. A very good chance to complete the Caulfield & Melbourne Cups double.(4) BREAKUP (Japan) Trainer: Tatsuya Yoshioka / Jockey: Kohei MatsuyamaAge/Sex: 6YO / HorseBarrier: 18 Weight: 55kgCareer Record: 22:5-3-4Career Prize Money: $2,200,392Winning Distance Range: 2200m-2500mTAB Fixed Odds: $19The Japanese are well known to be the breeders of the best horses in the world and they bring one over for this years race. We saw BREAKUP compete in The Caulfield Cup where he did get caught up in the fast speed they ran early in the race and he tired to finish 8th. He clearly needed that run to get some extra fitness leading into this race. One of the big question marks around BREAKUP is if he can see out a strong 3200m race. If he does handle that trip, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him cross the line if the first few and a good price. Each-way player.

He is a 3x Group 1 winner in Europe and his credentials as a staying horse are probably the best in this field. He should have no problems running out the 3200m and his barrier draw will see him get a very economical run. He did some track work at Flemington earlier in the week that was the talk of the town behind the scenes due to how impressive he looked as well and how nicely he travelled when running. The wispers will have rocked the rest of the field. The team have had a long term plan to compete in this race so expect him to be in top shape. But we will be keeping an eye on him in the mounting yard, the warm conditions may be something he hasn’t experienced before and you don’t want to see him getting to hot and bothered before he has even stepped onto the track. If his manners are in check in the mounting yard, he does look like he may be very hard to beat. (6) SOULCOMBE (Great Britain) Trainer: Chris Waller / Jockey: Joao MoreiraAge/Sex: 5YO / GeldingBarrier: 4Weight: 53.5kgCareer Record: 15:5-1-1Career Prize Money: $792,306Winning Distance Range: 1700m-2800mTAB Fixed Odds: $10An imported stayer who was brought out here 12 months ago with this race in mind. He runs like he should have no issues at all seeing out the 3200m trip and ran a very good Caulfield Cup run when flashing home to run by a few and finish 7th. Outside of that, his lead up races have all been very good. He has been having problems in his last few starts though with being very slow to jump away from the barriers. He cannot afford to miss the kick in this race like he did in The Caulfield Cup, it will make his job extremely tough given he will jump from barrier 4 and could find himself crowded early and with not a lot of room. But if he jumps well and at least gets away on even terms everyone else and can settle closer, he is a big chance, but that’s the risk you take with him. Good play Each-way.(7) ABSURDE (France) Trainer: Willie Mullins / Jockey: Zac PurtonAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 8Weight: 53kgCareer Record: 15:4-6-2Career Prize Money: $704,905Winning Distance Range: 2000m-4000mTAB Fixed Odds: $21ABSURDE is the stable mate of race favourite VAUBAN, but he does also have strong credentials himself as a staying type horse. In August, ABSURDE won The Ebor at York (UK) over the 2816m, that race gives runners a golden ticket into the Melbourne Cup. ABSURDE also ran 2nd behind VAUBAN at Ascot (UK) last year, while he was beaten that day by a big 7.5 length margin, he gets to carry significantly less weight in this race and he has a good record on a Good rated track which we will be more than likely racing on come Tuesday afternoon. He isn’t the roughest option and is a good Each Way hope.(8) RIGHT YOU ARE Trainer: Ciaron Maher & David Eustace / Jockey: John AllenAge/Sex: 7YOBarrier: 15 Weight: 53kgCareer Record: 26:10-4-4Career Prize Money: $1,095,805Winning Distance Range: 1400m-2400mTAB Fixed Odds: $61Ran 5th in this year’s Caulfield Cup but there was more to the eye than his finishing position. The leaders in the race (including himself) ran a very fast tempo early before most dropped off late fading out and finishing back through the field. RIGHT YOU ARE managed to fight on late and held onto 5th position, sticking on better than others which was a very encouraging effort and an effort that suggests the 3200m trip won’t concern him much. If the race is run to suit him, he could give this a shake and is one of the better roughie chances.(9) VOW AND DECLARE 2019 was a long time ago for Vow and Declare. Picture: Jason EdwardsTrainer: Danny O’Brien / Jockey: Billy EganAge/Sex: 8YO / GeldingBarrier: 19Weight: 53kgCareer Record: 37:5-7-4Career Prize Money: $7,103,920Winning Distance Range: 1800m-3200mTAB Fixed Odds: $34Was the winner of the 2019 Melbourne Cup but he has found things a lot tougher since that day given his ratings went through the roof. With his rating back down now, he gets to carry a more manageable weight and is clearly proven capable of running out this trip. His recent runs in The Moonee Valley Cup and The Might & Power were encouraging and suggest he is somewhere close to his best form, but he probably needs to turn the clock back a few years to produce an effort big enough to win this. Top 10 chance.(10) CLEVELAND (Ireland)Trainer: Kris Lees / Jockey: Michael DeeScratched after compulsory vet check. (11) ASHRUN (France) Trainer: Ciaron Maher & David Eustace / Jockey: Kerrin McEvoyAge/Sex: 8YO / GeldingBarrier: 11Weight: 51.5kgCareer Record: 17:4-3-1Career Prize Money: $578,819Winning Distance Range: 2200m-2500mTAB Fixed Odds: $41Has recently spent a long time off with injury since he competed in the 2020 Melbourne Cup where he finished 10th. He has now strung 3 races together and will have a solid fitness base behind him leading into this. His last start effort to run 2nd in The Geelong Cup was an encouraging sign that he may be about to find his peak form. The stable is confident he will see out a strong 3200m trip and will be hitting the line strongly late. He isn’t the roughest hope in this if he produces his best, not the worst bet for punters who like to back roughies.(12) DAQIANSWEET JUNIOR (NZ)Trainer: Phillip Stokes / Jockey: Daniel StackhouseAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 12Weight: 51.5kgCareer Record: 27:7-1-2Career Prize Money: $798,642Winning Distance Range: 1600m-3200mTAB Fixed Odds: $101Is a proven stayer that has previously run really well when he has contested races over the 3200m trip including running 6th in this race last year and he was the winner of the 2022 Adelaide Cup. He may be slightly past his prime nowadays which is the query on him, and may find it tough to win this race, but he may be a hope to finish in the top 10 based on his record over this trip and the fact he likes a dry track will help him, but only if the showers stay away.(13) OKITA SOUSHI (IRE) Trainer: Joseph O’Brien / Jockey: Dylan GibbonsAge/Sex: 6YO / HorseBarrier: 20Weight: 51.5kgCareer Record: 13:4-2-3Career Prize Money: $181,538Winning Distance Range: 2150m-3200mTAB Fixed Odds: $101Never really got going in The Caulfield Cup when he found himself settling last in the field and then he was really only grinding towards the finish line. His best chance is the fact that rising in trip to the 3200m does suit him now. But he will need to improve a lot from that Caulfield Cup run to be competitive in this. (14) SHERAZ (FR) Trainer: Chris Waller / Jockey: Beau MertensAge/Sex: 7YO / GeldingBarrier: 22Weight: 51.5kgCareer Record: 23:4-5-2Career Prize Money: $645,502Winning Distance Range: 2200m-3000mTAB Fixed Odds: $126His best effort since arriving in Australia in 2021, was when he ran 2nd in the 2022 Sydney Cup which is run over the same 3200m trip. Outside of that, his recent efforts aren’t what you would expect from a horse that comes out and wins a Melbourne Cup. The dry track is also against him as he prefers when it is wet. Hard to have for this level of race.(15) LASTOTCHKA (FR) Trainer: Mick Price & Michael Kent (Jnr) / Jockey: Craig WilliamsAge/Sex: 5YO / MareBarrier: 21Weight: 51kgCareer Record: 12:4-2-1Career Prize Money: $292,365Winning Distance Range: 1800m-3100mTAB Fixed Odds: $26Intriguing runner who makes her Australian debut in The Melbourne Cup. She should have no issues seeing out the 3200m trip, she was a Group 3 level winner over a 3100m in her last start in France. All the chatter is that are that she looked very good completing some track work at Flemington earlier this week as well. Her record suggests she would prefer that the track was a bit wet so look for those showers to hopefully hit the track, but also don’t be surprised to see her run a strong race here as an each-way hope.(16) MAGICAL LAGOON (Ireland)Queensland jockeys Ben Thompson and Mark Du Plessis will ride in the 2023 Melbourne Cup.

But he is rising well up in grades here and will need to improve a fair bit to be able to win a race like this. His best chance will likely be if he can lead the race early and then control the tempo of how fast the race is being run and try to steal it with a bold run. He does looks tested here.(17) MILITARY MISSION (Ireland) Trainer: Gai Waterhouse & Adrian Bott / Jockey: Rachel KingAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 5Weight: 51kgCareer Record: 27:7-5-3Career Prize Money: $798,895Winning Distance Range: 1900m-2400mTAB Fixed Odds: $41Won The Group 2 Herbert Power Stakes over the 2400m last start and has had a good trial since then to maintain his fitness levels. This is a step up in class now though and he needs a lot to go right to win. He will carry a light weight and jump from barrier 5 which should see him land in a handy position in running but does look only capable of a place chance at best.(18) SERPENTINE (Ireland) Trainer: Gai Waterhouse & Adrian Bott / Jockey: Jye McNeilAge/Sex: 7YO / GeldingBarrier: 1Weight: 51kgCareer Record: 21:3-3-1Career Prize Money: $919,079Winning Distance Range: 2000m-2400mTAB Fixed Odds: $71The Lloyd Williams-owned horse finished well down the field in this race last year but he was coming off of a 3 day turn around so there were some definite excuses for him. He likes a dry track and from barrier 1 looks the most likely leader in the early parts of this race. The rise in class will test him though so his best hope will be if he can lead from start to stop. Jye McNeil is in the saddle and he managed to produce an all the way victory in the 2020 Cup on TWILIGHT PAYMENT, will need a repeat effort here if they are going to win.(19) VIRTUOUS CIRCLE (NZ) Trainer: Liam Howley / Jockey: Craig NewittAge/Sex: 4YO / HorseBarrier: 6Weight: 51kgCareer Record: 13:2-2-1Career Prize Money: $687,700Winning Distance Range: 1500mTAB Fixed Odds: $126The youngest horse in the race who is taking a big step up in grade to compete in this Cup.

He has had one Australian run where he ran an impressive 5th hitting the line very strongly late in The Geelong Cup. That suggested that he appreciate the rise to the 3200m trip now and he can take some good improvement out of that first Australian run. He has raced against both VAUBAN & ABSURDE this year and was well beaten by both so may need to improve a lot of lengths to catch those two at least. He has also drawn the widest barrier in barrier 24 and it may take a gem of a ride from Jamie Kah to get him in the right position from wide out there.(21) FUTURE HISTORY (Great Britain)Trainer: Ciaron Maher & David Eustace / Jockey: Hollie DoyleAge/Sex: 6YO / GeldingBarrier: 13Weight: 50kgCareer Record: 16:6-4-1Career Prize Money: $585,188Winning Distance Range: 1800m-2500mTAB Fixed Odds: $26WWon his ticket into this race when winning The Group 3 Bart Cummings at Flemington a month ago which warrants automatic entry into the Melbourne Cup. He has since had a run in The Moonee Valley Cup, finishing 3rd but, it was really only a good tick over run to maintain his fitness levels. This is a step up in class for him and his hardest test to date and the distance may test him.There was some big news surrounding the runner on Tuesday morning with stewards announcing they had been advised of plans for Doyle to ride the gelding forward.Doyle will be aiming to become just the second female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup after Michelle Payne’s famous win on Prince Of Penzance in 2015. She is the first international jockey to ride in the race.Under the rules of racing, connections are obliged to advise stewards of any changes to tactics used in their previous run.The tactical change is obviously a massive gamble.

This is a few steps up in grade now which will test him and when he did compete in this race last year, he failed to finish.

He will now have to produce a big effort to turn around and back that up with only a three day break in between. It will be an impressive feat from the stable if they do get him to turn around fast enough and back up to win this. He is a real griding type of stayer so should have no real problems running out the 3200m if he backs up, but this level of race will really test him.

Picture: HBOFran HodgettsFrom the outset Fran Hodgetts appears to be the chief suspect with the best motive to kill Mr Moriaty.Ms Hodgetts ran the Devonshire Tea House where she would sell pies filled with crocodile, camel or buffalo.She had a long-running feud with Mr Moriaty, her direct neighbour, who she accused of poisoning her plants and even once throwing a dead kangaroo into her bedroom.During an inquest into Mr Moriaty’s death a former employee of Ms Hodgetts said she used to say “I’ll kill Paddy”, although the employee said he did not take the threats seriously and added that Ms Hodgetts used to say she would also kill her husband Billy.Ms Hodgetts emphatically denies any involvement in Mr Moriarty’s disappearance.“As much as I hated the man, I can swear to God I don’t know what happened to him,” she said in the documentary. Fran Hodgetts had an ongoing feud with her neighbour Paddy but denies she had anything to do with his disappearance.Richard SimpsonPub barman Richard Simpson was close friends with Mr Moriaty but neighbours speculated that the pair could have had a falling out over Mr Moriaty getting more shifts at the pub than him.They also pointed to the fact that Mr Simpson was close enough to Mr Moriaty to get near his dog, who generally hated everyone else.As for what happened to Mr Moriaty’s body, there was talk that whoever killed him could have fed him to the pub’s crocodile. When asked about the suggestion he killed Mr Moriaty, Mr Simpson said: “I didn’t do it. Me and Paddy had a few arguments about this, that or the other but never had a cross word that evening.“(Locals Karen and Mark Rayner) said I killed Paddy because I wanted to run the Larrimah pub and that’s really insulting because anyone who knows me knows I f**king hate working!”Barry Sharpe, the owner of the Larrimah Hotel & Pub and a beefy pet crocodile. Picture: HBOOwen LaurieOwen Laurie moved in with Ms Hodgetts after her marriage with Billy Hodgetts broke down.He would do her gardening, although she didn’t pay him, and said he made her feel safe.Karen and Mark Rayner said they witnessed a row between Mr Laurie and Mr Moriaty over Mr Moriaty’s dog a few days before he went missing.Mr Laurie was the only resident to decline to take part in the documentary.After Mr Moriaty’s death police taped his nearest neighbours and a recording of a man’s voice was played to his inquest.“F***king killed Paddy, hit him on the head,” the recording said. “Smacked him on the f***ing nostrils with my claw hammer.“I killerated old Paddy … I struck him on the f***ing head and killerated the bastard … basherated (sic) him.”Mr Laurie has denied that it is his voice on the recording and strongly denies killing Mr Moriaty.Fran's gardener, Owen Laurie, denied he killed Paddy. Credit: NetflixInquestAt Mr Moriaty’s inquest, Coroner Greg Cavanagh said the evidence showed that Mr Moriaty and his dog, Kellie, had both died the evening they went missing. “In my opinion, Paddy and his dog were killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbour,” Mr Cavanagh said.“He likely died on the evening of 16 December 2017. He had ridden home from the hotel, put the mostly-eaten chicken in the microwave, put his wallet on the table, his hat in the usual place, the dog food in the dog bowl and got his own meal out of the freezer.“He then went outside with the dog. There is no evidence as to where he went, however, in my view it’s likely that the new plants at Fran’s place were of some attraction to him.”What does the director think happened?Director Thomas Tancred said he developed his own theories on what happened while he was filming the documentary. Speaking to film website Screen Rant he said: “I was constantly coming up with theories”. “Also, there’s a lot of stuff, obviously, that can’t get into the film even though it’s two hours.“People would pull me aside and tell me things; people would tell me really interesting things about people I didn’t even really think would be a part of this or were capable of doing such a thing. Also, it’s such an interesting world out there.“It’s not in the film anymore, but at one point there was a story of this white van that was in town. There are these sinkholes that are near Larrimah, and somebody told me he could be thrown in there. The whole time I was coming up with theories in my head too,” Mr Tancred said. “And that’s the thing about the film too; it’s a whodunit. You have to explain all those theories to get to the end, to hopefully find out what happened.”Read related topics:Netflix",0.177,0.775,0.048,-0.9994

Everything the Aussie football manager has touched has turned to gold at Tottenham this season with the London club sitting on top of the Premier League table. After winning three consecutive “manager of the month” awards, the former A-League coach has turned Tottenham into every Australian’s second-favourite team. There are limits to the adoration, however. A photo of the former Celtic manager meeting with Collingwood star Josh Daicos in London this week has put Carlton fans in an awkward position. Fresh from the club’s AFL premiership victory, Daicos was given a behind the scenes tour of the Premier League giant’s training facilities as part of an off-season holiday in Europe. That visit, organised by a mutual sponsor shared between Tottenham and Collingwood, included a meeting with Postecoglou, who appeared just as excited about meeting the Aussie footy star as the Magpie was about meeting the hottest man in world football right now. “It’s been really good to meet a few of the players and watch them train. Just seeing the facilities here, it’s probably by far the best venue I’ve been to,” Daicos said in a video shared by Tottenham.“The way they cater for their players is quite amazing and you can see why they’re on top of their game at the moment.“Training is quite intense and you can see the attention to detail. It’s very similar to us in terms of splitting off into groups and focusing on individual needs.“We draw massive inspiration from these boys and to watch the likes of Sonny [Son Heung-min] and the rest of them go about it has been amazing.”To some however, the photo is sacrilege with Postecoglou a vocal supporter of Carlton, Collingwood’s bitter rival. Josh Daicos and Ange Postecoglou. Photo: Facebook, Tottenham Hotspur.Postecoglou showed his support for Carlton in September when the Blues made a thrilling run into the preliminary finals before they were knocked out by Brisbane. “Go the Blues. They’ve had a great year and we’ve had a long period without success. Good luck to Michael Voss and the boys,” Postecoglou said from a media conference in London before Carlton’s clash. Postecoglou has deep ties with Carlton and was even part of the committee that was responsible for the club appointing Brendon Bolton as head coach in 2016. It’s why some Blues fans weren’t happy to see the loved Carlton figure all chummy with Daicos.One fan on the official Reddit AFL group page said: “Poor form from a Carlton fan. Shame on u Ange”. There were plenty of other light-hearted comments about Postecoglou’s betrayal. Collingwoods Josh Daicos (centre) with runners up Nick Daicos and Brayden Maynard after winning the Copeland Trophy. Photo: Aaron Francis / Herald Sun.“As a long suffering Blues and Spurs supporter, I don’t know how I should feel about this,” one fan posted.There were plenty more Aussie fans on Spurs’ social media channels that loved the cross over between Aussie sports overseas.Meanwhile, after a win over Crystal Palace last week, Postecoglou’s team went five points clear at the top of the table. The Australian’s 26 points from his opening 10 games in charge is the best return of any new manager in Premier League history.Not since Spurs last won the league in 1960-61 have they enjoyed such an advantage at the summit of the English top flight.",0.043,0.74,0.217,0.999

Yarbrough and her then partner, former cricket captain Michael Clarke, made national headlines in January when their emotionally-charged carpark stoush in the tourist town was recorded by a bystander and obtained by The Daily Telegraph.In the clip, Yarbrough could be heard accusing Clarke of “f**king” Edwards, who he dated between mid-2020 and late-2021, “on December 17”.At the time, Edwards – who is the co-founder of Australian activewear brand P.E Nation -distanced herself from the public spat, saying: “This is not my circus. Yet again, Michael in his true nature has not taken responsibility for his actions and I was blatantly lied to.”However, after attending the first event of the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival at Flemington on Saturday, both women ended up at the same after-party at the city’s Beverly Rooftop. News.com.au understands the pair “didn’t go near” each other at the party or even exchange pleasantries, with onlookers describing the public encounter as “awkward”.

A channel is dug around it to stop water pooling on rainy days. Paul* lives in a makeshift camp in Sydney’s CBD. Picture: Jack EvansStacked neatly around his sleeping quarter are some other material comforts like fishing rods, a broken generator he’s been trying to fix, a cricket set and a couple of bikes.These are his life’s possessions piled methodically on the roughly ten square metre patch of dirt he calls home.“I’m not happy here,” he says. “But I’m not here forever.” Paul speaks excitedly about starting skills training and finally applying for social housing once his citizenship application is submitted. However, after ten years of living on Sydney’s streets and working brief stints as a labourer when he can, that reality still seems a while off.Tent city triples in sizeIn ebbs and flows spanning decades, Sydney’s homeless have called the well-covered arches forming the footings of the Glebe and Wentworth Park railway viaduct home. Paul lives in one of the 17 arches that span the park; all but one currently contain makeshift dwellings, some more established than others. Sydney’s homeless have called Wentworth Park home for decades. Picture: Jack EvansIn recent months, those privy to the park’s population say its transient community has roughly tripled in size. Sarah Morris, director of Acts of Kindness Community Outreach, has spent years visiting the park during weekly food drops. Sarah Morris, director of Acts of Kindness Community Outreach. Picture: Jack EvansA bubbly soul who is on a first-name basis with the community there, she too told news.com.au the community of rough sleepers has grown considerably in a matter of months. “In the last couple of months, we’ve gone up to about 27 dwellings when normally we sit at about eight to 10,” she said. She said some calling the arches home are symptoms of systemic failures while others are contently there on their own accord. “It’s a real mixed bag,” she said. While some form a small fraction of the some-58,000 applicants currently waiting for social housing in New South Wales, Ms Morris said there is a section of the campers who are not Australian citizens – and are there due to their ineligibility. “They don’t have citizenship, so they’re entitled to nothing,” she said. The homeless community is a ‘mixed bag’, with some being symptoms of systemic failures while others are contently there on their own accord. Picture: Jack EvansShe estimates roughly half of the current population are immigrants. Others have been coming and going for years. Some have been there for the long term despite attempts to move them on, and they are uninterested in accessing social housing. “Some are drug affected, and they choose to be there, but we’ve got two guys who have been down there for five or six years, and there’s no helping them because they don’t want anything,” Ms Morris said. Some of the campers are not Australian citizens and are there due to their ineligibility for social housing. Picture: Jack EvansWhether they want help, are entitled to it, or they are content on sleeping rough, one observation has become abundantly clear in recent months – the population is growing.Their presence, according to volunteers, the homeless community itself, and some neighbours along the adjacent Wentworth Road, seldom causes issues. However, when the council removes hoarded rubbish – minor tensions are briefly sparked. A ‘family dinner’ Ms Morris and her organisation are among several feeding the community at the park, while others help in other areas like housing applications, immigration forms and health checks. The bridge section on Wentworth Park Road pumps at 5.45pm each Thursday as Ms Morris and her small but dedicated crew of volunteers open their free, supermarket-like stand with rescued food from businesses across the city.What’s on offer is a massive mix of non-perishables and pre-prepared meals ready to eat in the next few days, most of which Ms Morris has toiled over herself. Despite attempts to move homeless people on, some have been there long term and are uninterested in accessing social housing. Picture: Jack EvansThe population of homeless people in New South Wales has grown rapidly, with 120,000 people estimated to sleep rough each night. Picture: Jack EvansThe residents of the bridge all gather and make the most of the offering. Plenty from outside the area or nearby social housing units also join. By the end, there’s little left. Despite the dire circumstances of many there, Ms Morris creates an infectiously positive vibe. Campers move deckchairs to the stall for a yarn over a cigarette and tea as Aussie hip-hop blares away from Ms Morris’ speakers in the background. “This is my family dinner,” Ms Morris gleefully exclaimed while packing up on Thursday night. Organisations rally New South Wales Health, along with St Vincent Hospital, have begun pop-up monthly clinics at Wentworth Park where the campers can access a free health check-up. An immigration lawyer frequently visits and assists the homeless immigrants with citizenship. Ms Morris believes most stakeholders are doing their best. “They’re trying really hard to figure out how to help out the people down there.”Wentworth Park is just one of many Sydney sites rough sleepers call home.

Crisis and temporary accommodation facilities are almost at full capacity, with 93 per cent occupancy, signalling a shortage of available beds.

A City of Sydney spokesperson told news.com.au that while housing and addressing homelessness is a NSW Government responsibility, the City of Sydney continues to address the issue with its Australian-first dedicated homelessness unit.The spokesperson also mentioned, “Every day, the City of Sydney’s public space liaison officers are on city streets, including Wentworth Park, visiting people sleeping rough and helping to link them with services they need and organisations that can further assist them.”Regarding people sleeping rough without Australian citizenship, the spokesperson added, “People sleeping rough who do not hold Australian citizenship face additional challenges in accessing government services and support.”“We are working to draw the government’s attention to the minimal housing options available to this community,” they said.

107,152,757012023128776,"OPINION: Former PM John Howard sparked a debate when he made a surprising Aussie confession but, respectfully, he’s wrong, says Joe Hildebrand.",2023-11-03 18:20:02,6.0,9,0,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/john-howard-is-wrong-multiculturalism-is-australian/news-story/aec7cd7f762916a6839259a61ba0000d?utm_campaign=EditorialSB&utm_source=News.com.au&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_content=SocialBakers,6,"John Howard is wrong, multiculturalism is Australian","OPINIONJohn Howard is, by the numbers alone, one of the most successful prime ministers Australia has ever had. And, as he famously observed with his trademark simplicity, politics is all about the numbers.His true strength, however, flowed not from factional calculations or fancy electoral math but from an instinctive understanding of where Middle Australia was at; what it felt and — perhaps more importantly — how it felt. He was a master of reading the national mood.And this is what makes his confession this week that he “always had trouble” with the concept of multiculturalism so troubling in itself. It is a severe misreading by the master.Former Prime Minister John Howard commented this week that “multiculturalism is a concept that I’ve always had trouble with”. Picture: James Whatling / Parsons MediaThis is not to suggest that Howard or others who have expressed similar concerns about multiculturalism come from a position of prejudice or hate. They are not racist, they are merely wrong.And this is borne out by every piece of available evidence in the great thriving democracy we call Australia.Howard’s call is one for unity, that immigrants ought to “adopt the values and practices” of their new home, and it is a call no doubt made in good faith. However it is also both absurd and impossible.At no point in any nation’s history has there ever been a fully united set of values and practices shared by the whole population, let alone in Australia’s.From the very beginning the values and practices of the settlers who arrived in 1788 were utterly alien to the values and practices of the First Australians who had already lived here for tens of thousands of years.And even among the first immigrants themselves were chasmic differences in values and practices. Did an Irish Catholic convict doing seven years hard labour share the same values of a high-ranking naval officer of a nation in which practising Catholicism was illegal?Clearly migrant assimilation was off to a rocky start.Who gets to set the values on what is and isn’t Australian? Picture: Julian AndrewsIn the decades and centuries since the story has been just as rollicking and random. The most famous historical touchstones all testify to that.In the 19th century a rambunctious chap called Ned Kelly, the most iconic Australian folk hero of all, had diametrically opposite values to the government that was pursuing him — he killed a number of policemen to make that point.And the White Australia policy, which lasted well into the second half of the 20th century, was originally engineered so that would-be immigrants had to pass a test that could be in any of a number of prescribed European languages.Why? So officials had an excuse to reject even those who desperately tried to adopt the ways of their hoped-for home by learning the Queen’s English. So much for assimilation.The great post-war European migration then gave way to a great migration from South Vietnam, thousands of people who were fleeing communism. These people surely shared official Australian values of democracy and free enterprise. Yet a decade later Howard — in comments which to his credit he later regretted — said Asian immigration should be curtailed.As it turned out the growing number of Asian immigrants in Howard’s own electorate, such as the large Chinese community of Eastwood, became some of his most vital supporters.John Howard campaigns with Liberal candidate, John Alexander in Eastwood in the seat of Bennelong in 2017. John Feder/The Australian.Meanwhile there are Chinatowns all over Australia where signs and menus are in Mandarin or Canton and a word of English will rarely darken a kitchen door. Are we really to believe that this is an indicator of social decay?There are countless other examples throughout Australian history and society but the weird thing is the biggest and clearest proof of all just blasted itself onto the national stage.For months Howard and other conservatives made the case against an Indigenous Voice to Parliament on the basis that it would divide Australia along racial lines. Obviously I disagreed but let us take them at their word.Because you know who really took them at their word? The most multicultural communities in the nation. The electorates with the highest populations of migrants and second generation Australians were the ones who overwhelmingly voted No.These were places like the western and southwest suburbs of Sydney which positively explode with different cultures, different languages, different religions and different practices and yet presented with the faintest unsubstantiated whiff that something could potentially be racially divisive they voted against it at a rate of about two to one.The No vote for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament was overwhelming in many culturally diverse areas. Picture: Jenny Evans/Getty ImagesIn other words the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the country all heaved towards what they thought was unity, while happily continuing their own myriad values and practices without a care in the world.But the greatest irony of all is that there are already regimes that demand and receive national unity and shared values. China and Russia are two that spring to mind. Because the ultimate expression of unified national values and practices is communism or any other form of one-party state.Liberal democracy, by contrast, is a celebration of difference – or at the very least an acceptance of it. Democracy, it is worth remembering, is the fundamental belief that people with differing views can peacefully coexist if we all accept that we all have a say even if we might not always get what we want.And the “liberal” part allows that even those who might dissent or disagree with the majority verdict still have rights as individuals that cannot be trampled over by the mob.More CoverageJohn Howard’s surprising Aussie confessionAustralia ‘lucky’ it was colonised – HowardThus democracy itself is in its very essence multicultural. It absorbs rather than dictates. Its fragility and flexibility is in fact its greatest strength.So look to the most ancient cornerstone of Judaeo-Christian tradition in Israel. Look to the modern world’s oldest and most powerful democracy in the USA. And look to Australia, the most multicultural nation on the planet.Then tell me where you’d rather be.Read related topics:Joe Hildebrand",0.062,0.781,0.157,0.9989

That day, the BBC’s Dyson inquiry had found that disgraced journalist Martin Bashir had used falsified documents and lied to get Diana, Princess of Wales to agree to her famous 1995 Panorama interviews. Harry, both barrels blazing, took aim at the British press and spoke about the “culture of exploitation and unethical practices [that] ultimately took her life.”It was powerful and raw, a son defending his mother’s memory from the rapacious forces that played such a devastating role in her life. Martin Bashir interviews Princess Diana in Kensington Palace for the television program Panorama. Picture: Corbis via Getty ImagesYou know this story, the world knows this story, it’s a narrative bedded down and etched in rock: Diana was the perennial victim of the villainous and predatory forces of Fleet Street.But, is that the whole story? This is the question that Season 6 of The Crown(landing on Netflix on November 16) might be about to ask: What exactly was the troubled and troubling relationship between the princess and the press? How complicit was the woman, described by her brother Earl Spencer at her funeral as “the most hunted person of the modern age,” in feeding what the media critic Stephen Glover called “the beast”?Make no mistake, this is messy and fraught territory that challenges the prevailing, entrenched image of Diana as martyr, as a totemic sacrifice to the press.

Picture: Daniel Escale/NetflixOne of the new stills from the final season of The Crown shows a swimsuit-clad Diana posing for photographers, recreating a scene that took place in July 1997, the month before her death. The princess, then aged 36, had accepted an invitation from Harrods owner and controversial billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed to stay with him in the South of France. Out Diana flew from London for a luxe holiday with her sons Prince William and Prince Harry and out flew Fleet Street snappers and the freelance paparazzi.According to esteemed biographer Sally Bedell Smith, the princess started the trip by “[Eluding the] paparazzi by crawling along a balcony and hiding behind a towel” only to then change tack and to actually go and speak to them. “You are going to get a big surprise, you’ll see. You are going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do,” she told the press. (“Diana Teases Press Corps With Promise Of ‘Surprise’” read the Chicago Tribune headline from that day.)This direct engagement and a certain handfeeding, if you will, of the media “beast” that swirled around her was far from a one-off. Al Fayed’s Jonikal, the location of one of the most famous shots of Princess Diana, sitting on the edge of its diving board in 1997. Picture: Pool RAT/REY/Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesTake what would have to be one of the most famous images of all time, the iconic shot of Diana on board Al Fayed’s Jonikal taken on August 24, 1997 showing her sitting on the edge of the super yacht’s diving board. This was not a solitary moment stolen by the intrusive press but an image that “suited” Diana to have taken, according to Jason Fraser, the photographer involved in getting the shot. Fraser would later tell the Daily Mail he had been “invited” by the Princess of Wales to shoot her during that August 1997 holiday with her new boyfriend Dodi Al Fayed. “I knew that Diana had wanted [the photos] to be taken,” Fraser has said. “I was always nearby, ready to capture these historic images and that suited us both.” Look further and you can find a veritable chorus of highly credible voices all saying very much the same thing – that Diana was no innocent when it came to the press. Bedell Smith reported for Vanity Fair that “in the last five years of Diana’s life, her contacts with British journalists were frequent, substantive, and often chummy.”According to Bedell Smith, Diana “instructed her staff to alert tabloid photographers to her comings and goings.” Princess Diana St Tropez in the summer of 1997, shortly before Diana and boyfriend Dodi were killed in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. Picture: Michel Dufour/WireImage“It is an undisputed fact that the Princess connived with the media and exploited it for her own interests, just as much as we exploited her for ours,” Sir David English, the late chairman of Associated Newspapers, has written. In The Diana Chronicles, the princess’s biographer and friend Tina Brown reported that the princess would ‘brief’ the Daily Mail’s Richard Kay and would ‘plant’ stories. (Diana would call Kay from Paris during that final, fateful trip.)Or take those famous 1993 photos of Diana, William and Harry at an amusement park, all dripping wet having gone down a log ride. Robert Hardman, at the time the (UK) Daily Telegraph’s royal correspondent and now a royal biographer, has said of that outing: “It was an entirely private engagement. Up turned the photographers to take some lovely pictures, and then they were asked to go away.”Princess Diana with sons Prince William Prince Harry at the Thorpe Park amusement park in 1993. Picture: Julian Parker/UK Press via Getty ImagesThat same year, Diana moved to a new gym called LA Fitness whose owner secretly installed a camera to photograph his most famous patron. When photos of the princess using a leg press machine were splashed all over the Mirror, she immediately sued. However, her longtime bodyguard Ken Wharfe “suspected that Diana had colluded in the pictures to contrive a high-profile confrontation with the press,” Brown reports. “Why was Diana wearing full make-up at 6.50 in the morning for a workout?” Wharfe has said. In the 90s, as the War of the Waleses dragged on, Diana, rather than keeping the men – and they were by and large men – of Fleet Street at arm’s length, was working on recruiting them to her cause. As famed royal reporter James Whitaker has said: “Diana was aware that if she was going to progress with Prince Charles she needed the press on her side.” During this time, she would host lunches at her Kensington Palace apartment for key editors and journalists, events which later came to include William. Princess Diana in 1996, leaving Kensington Palace in London. Picture: AFPPrincess Diana in St Tropez, 1997. Picture: Michel Dufour/WireImageBut just because Diana knew how to play the game, that does not mean she wasn’t simultaneously a victim too. If the princess had started to try and use the press to her own ends, was it only because she had suffered at their hands for so many years? Kay told Brown: “She ran a daily gauntlet. [Photographers] were parked in Kensington Court with their two-way radios and scanners monitoring her mobile phone calls.” Famed designer Jasper Conran and another Diana intimate has said of the press’s treatment of her: “She would go out, they used to say awful things to get a reaction, ‘Diana, you are a c**t,’ horrible things. It would make her cry.”Pap photos of the princess looking distraught after having learnt of her father’s death, taken while on a skiing holiday in Austria in 1992, were readily sold. All of this took a devastating toll on the princess. Bedell Smith has reported that Diana would feel so “despondent over her press coverage, she would drive to a cliff called Beachy Head on the southern coast of England and contemplate suicide, only to be drawn back by thoughts of her two sons.”In a final unspeakably disgusting and reprehensible act, the paps would photograph a mortally wounded princess in the back seat of the crumpled Mercedes. Now, more than 25 years on, how do we reconcile Diana The Hunted, racing down the streets of London, tormented by the leering lenses of the press, with the other Diana, the woman in her leopard-print cossie who teased a “a big surprise” and who had “instructed her staff to alert tabloid photographers to her comings and goings”?Princess Diana in Saint-Tropez, July 1997. Picture: Pool RAT/REY/Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesOne of the many grievances that the Duke of Sussex has raised about the royal family today is their relationship with the media, saying in Harry & Meghan: “You know there’s leaking, but there’s also planting of stories … It’s a dirty game.”The question is, will this new season of The Crown delve into the uncomfortable territory of whether Diana played this “dirty game” too?

Eden Thomson initially put the sound down to her son moving around in bed but when she checked the Vtech device, its camera was actually panning around his room. “I literally looked at the monitor and it was moving, like, panning the room,” Ms Thomson said in a now viral TikTok. “Someone hacked into my baby monitor and was looking around the room,” she added, revealing that only an hour earlier, she was in the room dressing her son after a shower. “We got him dressed in his room and at that point, the monitor was on as well.” Eden Thomson said her monitor got hacked. Picture: TikTok/edenthomson__It was about an hour after she put her son to bed. Picture: TikTok/edenthomson__The mum, who decided to throw the monitor away, issued a warning to other parents about the devices. “This is just a thing for the parents out there to be wary of your baby monitors, anyone can hack into them, it’s actually so easy for hackers to do that,” she said. “It’s very scary, so just be wary parents.” Ms Thomson showed footage taken from her phone showing the camera panning around her son’s room, with her heard saying, “oh my gosh, someone is moving our monitor, what do I do?”. Her Vtech device was not connected to her Wi-Fi, leaving some viewers questioning whether it was even possible for a stranger to gain access to the device. Owner of Expert IT Solutions, Paul Schnackenburg, told news.com.au that not only was it possible, it was extremely common. “Just because it’s not connected to Wi-Fi, doesn’t mean it’s not connected to something,” Mr Schnackenburg said. “For example, it could be connected to Bluetooth, which is definitely hackable.” Networks connected to other devices like gaming consoles or even the screen connected to the camera in the baby’s room were “definitely hackable”, he said. The camera typically only moved with these hand controls. Picture: TikTok/edenthomson__Baby monitors were just one modern device to explode in popularity in the last 10 years with “completely inadequate” security.“None of this stuff has anywhere near appropriate levels of security,” Mr Schnackenburg said. He referenced an investigation by security researcher Troy Hunt in 2019 who found a brand of smart watches for children could be easily hacked into to find a child’s location and alter it, while also listening to and speaking to them.“It’s unbelievably scary stuff,” he said, calling on Australian regulators to take smart device security more seriously.More Coverage7yo boy has brain surgery after school fightFour-year-old boy ‘bullied’ for vegan birthdayMr Schnackenburg proposed Australia adopt a protocol recently introduced in the United States, called the US Cyber Trust Mark, which applies a special sticker to devices with specific security and privacy features. news.com.au has sought comment from Vtech.brooke.rolfe@news.com.au",0.056,0.828,0.116,0.9881

Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesOn the other side of the equation, Ricciardo has impressed since his mid-season elevation from reserve driver to a seat at AlphaTauri, despite the car being labelled a “dump truck”.Although they’re playing at the other end of the field, Ricciardo’s seventh placed finish at the Mexican Grand Prix gave him six points and elevated AlphaTauri from last to eighth on the constructor’s championship.The prize money difference going from 10th to eighth is a staggering $US20m ($A32m) for the constructor at year’s end.But despite his performances proving he’s still got it, Ricciardo revealed that he’d not had talks with Red Bull — at least not yet.“I haven’t (spoken to Red Bull about replacing Perez). Obviously all the stuff around my contract next year has been related to AlphaTauri,” Ricciardo said.“So that’s honestly as far as that goes.“For me personally, having a weekend like Mexico is just definitely good for the soul.“And also for the team, you know. I haven’t been here long, but for them to be tenth in the constructors’ and to jump two places in the space of two weekends was huge.“So that kind of creates a very happy atmosphere around everyone. Kind of happy doing that and try to just keep charging on where I am.”Always with a smile Danny Ricc! Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesBut F1 fans will know things can change very quickly in Formula One and it’s no doubt that if Red Bull did want to move on from Perez, it wouldn’t take Ricciardo long to jump at the opportunity.However, the 34-year-old Aussie also knows the old adage is true — you’re only as good as your last race.“Obviously (in) this sport you’ve got to kind of keep backing it up,” Ricciardo said.“It’s nice to have a good weekend, but to just have one, in my mind, it’s not enough.“But, of course for me, to have a strong weekend from start to finish (in Mexico) I think spoke something. It was something that I have struggled with the last year or two – didn’t have many weekends like that.“This year was just about me rebuilding myself again and just trying to find … that old form or that old me. So Mexico felt a lot like that.”The rumour was the talk of the paddock at the Brazilian Grand Prix as Alonso had a furious response to the speculation that he was firming to move to the world champion team.The 42-year-old dismissed the speculation as “the normal paddock rumours from people who try to make fun of it and gain some followers (on social media),” before warning “I will make sure there are consequences.” When asked to elaborate, the Spaniard was advised by a team representative not to go any further.Verstappen was also questioned about the rumours and was asked if he had a preference of teammate for next year.C’mon Max, you know you want to get back together. Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images“I always had a great relationship with Daniel, when (we) were teammates, when of course we weren’t,” Verstappen said.“But at the same time I also have a great relationship with Checo and I find it a bit unfair to now sit here and say who I would prefer as a teammate or whatever.“They have been great teammates and it’s not up to me at the end of the day to make these kinds of decisions because I’m very focused on my own performance.More CoverageF1 in meltdown over bombshell rumourRicciardo caught in ‘car crash TV’ moment“If it’s Checo next year, then great.

Join Kayo now and start streaming instantly >The Panthers, who recently upped their offer to $850,000 a season, are said to be in a battle with the Canterbury Bulldogs and Wests Tigers to sign up the at-times controversial star.But earlier in the week, Panthers coach Ivan Cleary appeared to suggest that Luai may not want the pressure that comes with running a team by himself.“If any club, the money we are talking, the money he may consider leaving, it would have to be for that kind of role, which I would understand,” Cleary said.“Is he ready for that? That’s a question mark I would think. Can he do it? I’m sure he could do it. Has he done it? He hasn’t really. In this team he has his role to play. That’s a risk everyone would have to take.”Luai has three rings. Photo: NRL PHOTOSLuai plays second-fiddle to Nathan Cleary, who is one of the game’s best players and almost single-handedly dragged his side to a remarkable NRL grand final victory — the club’s third straight.But Luai didn’t appear to be too happy, hitting back with a reply via Instagram, writing: “Know your worth”.Speaking on The Daily Telegraph’s NRL Podcast, Newscorp journalist Brent Read believes Cleary made a mistake with his comments.“The fact is you are worth what someone is willing to pay you,” Read said.“So to say that he is not worth $1 million, well you know what when he goes to open market he will get $1 million, so that is what he is worth.“So it is whether you get value for the pay packet that is the issue.”The other potential suitors for Luai in the Tigers and Bulldogs also have strong links to the Panthers, with Api Koroisau the captain at Wests, while Canterbury have the likes of former Panthers assistant Cameron Ciraldo as head coach and former players such as Matt Burton, Viliame Kikau and Stephen Crichton, as well as GM of football Phil Gould.Luai may want to prove Ivan wrong. Photo by Bradley Kanaris/Getty ImagesThe Daily Telegraph’s Michael Carayannis said that the Tigers could have another card to play in new coach Benji Marshall.“The Tigers have an interest,” Carayannis said.“There are some interesting quotes from Jarome that he used to idolise Benji Marshall.“Benji was the star player that he really looked up to.”Read added: “They know they each other, they were roommates and teammates with the Maori All Stars two or three years ago,” Read said.“That’s when Jarome made those quotes. He said he loved Benji from the age of five when he saw Benji in the 2005 Grand Final.“He grew up with a Tigers towel that he used to dry himself with every day. It was a heartwarming story.”While that may sound strange, that story came out of Maori All Stars camp in 2021 when Luai admitted Marshall’s flick to Pat Richards in the 2005 grand final was a “memory that I’ll have for the rest of my life”. “I remember my mum got me a Tigers towel afterwards and I used it after every shower for the next five years – I just didn’t want to let go of it,” Luai said at the time.“I’ve been a fan of Benji ever since.”Anyway...Maybe leave that story out of the interview Jarome... Picture: NRL PhotosRead and Carayannis ruled out the likes of Canberra and St George to go for Luai, claiming it really is a three-horse race.But Read said Cleary will have to do some relationship repair following his comments, particularly since Luai has another year left on his deal.“The other thing about Ivan’s comments and the feedback to that is I reckon Jarome will be looking at that going, I can be the main man,” Read said.“It could actually prompt him to leave.“I think he would see that and go, well I can do it. If you doubt me I will go and do it somewhere else.“That is his only choice right? Because he can’t do it at Penrith because Nathan Cleary is there and Nathan will always be the main man at Penrith.”Luai has a huge call to make. Photo by Jeremy Ng/Getty ImagesCarayannis agreed.“It could light the fire in him,” Carayannis said.“The type of person and player that he is, well if you don’t think I can do it guess what? Maybe I will and I will show you I can do it.More CoverageShock twist in NRL transfer bombshellMunster’s message to five-eighth hopefuls“I kind of want him to leave because of the confidence that he has in himself and the headlines that he grabs he will wear it.“He wears it pretty well.

The former Married At First Sight contestant, who parlayed her exposure from the show into a successful career as a fashion and beauty influencer, has amassed a following of more than 700,000 followers on Instagram. Since welcoming her first child, son Lucius, with fiance Michael Brunelli in February, however, Kalifatidis said she now worried about sharing things her audience might misconstrue. “[Michael] said, ‘You never post organic raw stuff, your real life. Everything is so curated and you don’t post the way you used to’,” the 35-year-old said in a video on Wednesday night. The observation, Kalifatidis admitted, “struck a chord” with her because it was “true”.

I feel like it is. [But] it’s just what I think.” Kalifatidis pointed out that she “would never say that about my friends” who are also parents. “And yet I say that about myself. We are f**ked up as a human species. Why are we so horrible about ourselves? I’m going deep, I’m unpacking – I needed this,” she said. “All I want to talk about is my baby. Does anyone care? Probably not as many people as I think.” She ended the update by vowing to start sharing more candid posts again in the future. It’s not the first time the formerly very public influencer has touched on changing her approach when it comes to social media. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph in May, Kalifatidis said that while “babies really do bring out the best in people”, she’d been careful about sharing with fans how she and Brunelli were choosing to raise their son. “I’ve just stayed really quiet about the way I’ve chosen to do things and my opinions when it comes to parenting,” she said. ‘All I want to talk about is my baby. Does anyone care? Probably not as many people as I think.’ Picture: Instagram“The parenting and mum community online is such an intense place – it can be amazing, helpful and relatable, but God forbid you do something different to the next person – within hours you can have thousands of people commenting and reprimanding you, which would be so overwhelming for a new mum.More Coverage‘WTF’: Influencer vanishes amid furoreInfluencer’s raw ‘Roman Empire’ reveal“While I haven’t experienced it first hand, I’ve seen mums online go through it and it’s the reason I’ve chosen to stay quiet this time. “In saying all that, I’ve gotten very used to people commenting on everything I do, be it good or bad.“But when it comes to Lucius, I think Michael and I both have been really good at ignoring the scary, sad, and scolding messages and just enjoying our beautiful boy.” ",0.057,0.825,0.118,0.9823

The risks for the outlook are towards sticky inflation rather than a concerning drop in activity,’’ it said.Inflation is falling more slowly than expected. Picture: ABS, AMPLifting rates by 25 basis points would take the cash rate to 4.35 per cent on Tuesday after the RBA kept rates on hold at the last four meetings.Each 25 basis point increase in variable rates lifts monthly mortgage payments by about $15 for each $100,000 borrowed. For a $600,000 mortgage another rate rise would increase rates by $90 a month.Since the RBA began raising rates last May, the increases have increased payments by a whopping $1134 for those on a typical $500,000. That’s $13,000 a year in extra payments.The ANZ bank’s senior economist Blair Chapman warned on Friday that annual personal credit growth also recorded its strongest result in over a decade.This was likely due to cost-of-living pressure on households that do not have access to housing equity.“We expect the RBA to increase rates on Tuesday and to note in the Statement on Monetary Policy that it may need to tighten again,’’ he said.\Melbourne Cup day this year could come with a nasty surprise. Picture: Martin Keep/Getty Images for VRC“We expect a hawkish tone throughout the statement. We expect the Outlook chapter to emphasise upside risks to the outlook and the possibility of elevated inflation persisting.“The RBA is also likely to highlight downside risks, such as the possibility of slower growth in China.ANZ warned it expected the RBA to increase its near-term forecasts for headline and core inflation.The vast majority of financial experts are now betting on a Melbourne Cup Day interest rate rise next week.Separately, the latest macroeconomic outlook from State Street Global Advisors suggests the uncertainty from elevated inflation and the central bank’s efforts to stem this now seems destined to continue.“The markets are now embracing the ‘higher for longer’ narrative and pushing out expectations for rate cuts,’’ it said.“The primary theme in all the commentaries for the pause was quite hawkish, indicating caution against letting inflation get out of hand and warning that interest rates could stay elevated for a longer period of time. Some investors are bracing for a sustained period of higher rates.“The surge in oil prices over the last quarter, and now, potentially, the breakout of war in the Middle East, has maintained the significance of the said concerns.”On the flipside, it found the outlook was not as gloomy compared to peers, with Australia having lower recession risks than many other developed economies.“The RBA has tended to approach rate hikes with greater restraint than other global central banks, only raising rates by a cumulative 400 bps versus 525 bps by the Fed said.“Instead, the RBA has opted for several hawkish pauses instead. The pause in October serves an example of this stance. A hike is still an option for November.“Our expectations are that over the next few months the tighter monetary conditions will show a material effect on economic growth. However without any decline in inflation, policy reversal is unlikely.”Read related topics:MelbourneReserve Bank",0.066,0.847,0.087,0.9031

There were abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans as they waged, as you said at the United Nations, a painful struggle for independence and sovereignty – and for that, there can be no excuse,” the King said.“In coming back to Kenya, it matters greatly to me that I should deepen my own understanding of these wrongs, and that I meet some of those whose lives and communities were so grievously affected. “None of this can change the past. But by addressing our history with honesty and openness we can, perhaps, demonstrate the strength of our friendship today.

One customer told news.com.au he had been waiting three years for his house and there was “no end in sight”.The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, signed a contract in March 2020 and his build is still not complete. Customers have been left reeling.The customer claims the company “lied constantly to me with false finish dates and progress updates”. “My build has been a disaster since the first day I signed the contract,” he lamented. “I also think that GJ Gardner need to take responsibility for this outcome,” he said, adding that “at no point” did the master franchisor inform customers of the financial difficulties its Perth West branch was facing. A GJ Gardner Homes WA spokesperson, the state’s master franchisor, said the company had “provided ongoing support to the Perth West office including operational support, financial support and financial guidance for some time”.However, ultimately, the franchisee was hit by pressures the construction industry is battling with, including trade and supply line disruptions and increasing costs which resulted in “impacting its financial position”.The spokesperson added: “As the master franchisee of GJ Gardner Homes WA, we are here to support the customers, trades and suppliers directly involved by assisting with the insurance process and providing support where we can.”The GJ Gardner Perth West company, with an office in Osborne Park, had been a registered business since 2013. news.com.au has contacted the liquidators for comment.

Subiaco’s appeal lies in its connectivity to other areas, a wide range of amenities, diverse dining options, numerous shops, and of course, Subiaco stadium. Place Score founder Kylie Legge said the results emphasise that mixed-density inner-city environments with established landscapes are considered the most liveable.Subiaco, Western Australia was named Australia’s most liveable suburb.

At an event in New York on Thursday, US time, HBO chief executive Casey Bloys said new seasons of hits including The White Lotus and The Last of Us have been affected by the writers’ and then the actors’ strikes. “We’ve had to adjust across the board,” he said at an event to launch HBO’s slate of 2024 programming. Many of HBO’s shows air on Foxtel and Binge in Australia. But a raft of new programs, including season two of Games of Thrones’ spin off House of the Dragon, a fresh instalment of True Detective starring Jodie Foster, drama The Penguin from the DC Comics’ Batman universe and a comedy starring Kate Winslet as a rubbish dictator, will be on screens from the new year.US actor Jennifer Coolidge has been lauded for her performances in The White Lotus. Picture: Frederic J. Brown / AFP‘Had to adjust’The double strikes have hit not just HBO but all major media companies with productions either brought to a halt or not starting at all. Members of the Writers Guild of America went on strike from May to September. While the SAG-AFTRA actors’ strike began in July and is ongoing, holding up drama productions. Mr Bloys said a spin off from the horror film It, called Welcome to Derry, had been delayed by a year. “We had that scheduled for Halloween of ’24, but that’s likely pushing into ’25.”The third season of White Lotus, the comedy-drama focused on the lives of self-centred tourists at high end holiday resorts, was pencilled in for next year but now has been pushed to 2025, he said. Batman spin off The Penguin, starring an unrecognisable Colin Farrell in the lead role, will air in 2024 but later than planned. “The Penguin would have been in spring so we’ve had to adjust across the board.”The second series of smash hit computer game turned apocalyptic drama The Last of Us has also been moved.Mr Bloys said production would now begin in the northern spring of 2024 but that would depend on the outcome of the actors strike. If it’s not resolved it could be delayed further.“The Last of Us was one that was also affected by strikes and that would have been in pre-production already”.Stream all your favourite HBO shows on BINGE and Foxtel.

While most examples have naturally circulated and lost their original shine, a few have been preserved in pristine condition.This 1968 2-cent Australian coin is worth $495.

These coins represent the pinnacle of quality and desirability for collectors.What sets this coin apart, aside from its remarkable condition, is its unique history. The Australian two-cent coin was introduced in 1966 and circulated until 1992. Its reverse featured a frill-necked lizard designed by Stuart Devlin, a renowned coin designer. Notably, Mr Devlin’s initials, “SD,” were meant to appear under the lizard’s belly on these coins.However, an intriguing mystery surrounds some of these coins.

Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesIt’s far from the first time in recent history that England have claimed a victory despite not winning anything — Ashes anyone?England were adamant that they won the recent Ashes despite the 2-all draw, which meant that Australia have now retained the urn for the last four series.And since England have won just one series in Australia since 1986-87 (a total of nine series), including not winning a Test in the past three series’ Down Under.But Root claimed the match against Australia was the equivalent of a “World Cup final”.To be fair, it is as close as England will get to a World Cup final in this edition of the World Cup.“We have to remember that and take that into the next couple of days, both in physical practice and mentally, (we have to) make sure we‘re in that frame of mind to take on Australia, which is what it’s about for us now,” he said.“We’ve just got to look at Saturday as our World Cup final and play in the manner that’s expected of us and we expect of ourselves.“It hurts – it always hurts to be in this position to be sat at the bottom of the table. It’s not what we expect of ourselves. If it motivates us a little bit more, then great.”Got ‘em just where you want ‘em aye Joe? Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesMany Aussie legends have termed the match a bogey game for Australia against an English side that will be desperate to claim a win as the equivalent of a title.Australia have tried not to needle England during the World Cup, but after captain Pat Cummins couldn’t hide his laugh at the Poms’ humiliating loss to Sri Lanka and Marnus Labuschagne labelled the addition of Bazball to the Collins Dictionary as “garbage”, there’s no doubt the old enemy will use the perceived slights as fuel.Root also claimed there was no animosity with Australia, despite the fact England can’t seem to forget the Bairstow incident in the Ashes, where the England wicketkeeper was stumped after he wandered out of his crease.Extracts from a new book on Bazball released during the World Cup featured Bairstow relitigating the drama, with the Englishman even pulling the old “won’t someone think of the children” card to explain his brain fart.More CoverageAustralia ‘destabilised’ by star’s absenceCricket world in hysterics over statue blunderWhile the interview was likely done months ago, the timing of the release was no coincidence.However, Australia refuse to talk about the Bairstow incident and have moved on from the issue.England, we suggest you do the same.",0.106,0.796,0.098,-0.6801

Stone accused Carey and her team of copying his song’s “compositional structure,” according to the complaint obtained by Fox News Digital.Carey “directly” copied lyrics from Stone’s 1989 hit and “approximately 50 per cent” of the song is copyright infringement, the court documents stated.Stone claimed Carey and her team “undoubtedly” had access to his version of All I Want For Christmas is You due to its “wide commercial and cultural success.” Mariah Carey has been accused of copying another song also titled All I Want For Christmas is You. Picture: Terence Patrick/CBS via Getty ImagesStone’s song charted on Billboard for years, and his band performed the song during an appearance at the White House in the spring of 1994 — the same year Carey’s song was released.The White House performance put Vince Vance and the Valiants’ song back on the Billboard Hot Country Chart in 1994, according to the court docs.“Carey has capitalised on the success of her infringing work,” Stone’s complaint alleged. “All I Want For Christmas is You has become a ubiquitous part of popular culture, and Carey’s name has become synonymous with the season.”Carey’s hit holiday song has sold more than 10 million copies in the US alone since its release in 1994.A representative for Carey did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.Stone had first sued Carey in June 2022 in a Louisiana court before dropping the claim five months later, People magazine reported.Carey’s Christmas hit has been a holiday staple since it was released in 1994. All I Want For Christmas is You topped the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold more than 10 million copies.Carey has leaned into the success of the song and has begun teasing the Christmas season on social media by sharing a video announcing “It’s time” for All I Want for Christmas is You on Wednesday.This year’s video has amassed over 70 million views and received 2 million likes on Instagram.The singer-songwriter has previously shared how the song came to be in an interview with W Magazine.“The idea of me doing a Christmas album at all came from the record company,” Carey told the outlet. “It was very early in my career, and I thought it was a little early for me to be doing that, but I was like, ‘Well, I love Christmas.’ I had some very sad Christmases as a child, but I always try to find the bright light there.”More CoverageEx-husband says Mariah Carey is ‘not human’Mariah’s ‘dig’ at Meghan in new interview“I didn’t want it to feel specific to any era, so we didn’t use sounds that were happening at that time,” she explained. “That way, it would feel classic and timeless.“But I could never have imagined that it would become such a major part of my life.”This article originally appeared in Fox News and was reproduced with permission",0.029,0.892,0.078,0.9599
